d42b1af1-0792-4bb5-be7a-66a52060fe24,Journal Club with Dr. Peter Attia | Metformin for Longevity & The Power of Belief Effects,"In this journal club episode, my guest is Stanford and Johns Hopkins-trained physician, Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., who is also the host of The Drive podcast and the author of the bestselling book “Outlive: The Science & Art of Longevity.” We each present a scientific paper and discuss the findings’ strengths, weaknesses and actionable takeaways. First, we discuss an article that addresses whether taking the drug metformin can enhance longevity. Then, we discuss an article on belief effects (similar to placebo effects), showing how the effects of a drug on the brain and cognition depend on one’s belief about the dose of the drug taken, not the actual dose. Our conversation also highlights how to read, interpret and critique scientific studies. This episode ought to be of interest to those curious about health and longevity, medicine and psychology and for anyone seeking to better understand how to read and digest scientific findings.",https://hubermanlab.com/journal-club-with-dr-peter-attia-metformin-for-longevity-and-the-power-of-belief-effects/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=207s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=371s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=756s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=1187s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=1530s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=2179s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=2235s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=2667s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=3088s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=3677s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=3743s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=4140s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=4562s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=5028s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=5542s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=5890s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=6322s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=6667s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=7207s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=7514s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=7857s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=8346s,"00:00:00 Dr. Peter Attia, Journal Club; 00:03:27 Sponsors: Helix Sleep & Levels; 00:06:11 Dreams; 00:12:36 Article #1, Metformin, Mitochondria, Blood Glucose; 00:19:47 Type 2 Diabetes & Causes, Insulin Resistance; 00:25:30 Type 2 Diabetes Medications, Metformin, Geroprotection, Bannister Study; 00:36:19 Sponsor: AG1; 00:37:15 TAME Trial; Demographics, Twin Cohort; 00:44:27 Metformin & Mortality Rate; 00:51:28 Kaplan-Meier Mortality Curve, Error Bars & Significance, Statistical Power; 01:01:17 Sponsor: InsideTracker; 01:02:23 Hazard Ratios, Censoring; 01:09:00 Metformin Advantage?, Variables, Interventions Testing Program; 01:16:02 Berberine, Acarbose, SGLT2 Inhibitors; 01:23:48 Blood Glucose & Energy Balance; Caloric Restriction, Aging Biomarkers; 01:32:22 Tool: Reading Journal Articles, 4 Questions, Supplemental Information; 01:38:10 Article #2, Belief Effects vs. Placebo Effect; 01:45:22 Nicotine Effects; 01:51:07 Nicotine Doses & Belief Effects, fMRI Scan; 02:00:07 Biological Effects, Dose-Dependent Response & Belief Effects; 02:05:14 Biology & Beliefs, Significance, Dopamine Response, Non-Smokers; 02:10:57 Dose-Dependence & Beliefs, Side Effects, Nocebo Effect; 02:19:06 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media"
0d5ce4da-c818-427d-a178-b19358276d8b,GUEST SERIES | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Understand & Assess Your Mental Health,"This is episode 1 of a 4-part special series on mental health with psychiatrist Dr. Paul Conti, M.D., who trained at Stanford School of Medicine and completed his residency at Harvard Medical School before founding his clinical practice, the Pacific Premier Group. Dr. Conti defines mental health in actionable terms and describes the foundational elements of the self, including the structure and function of the unconscious and conscious mind, which give rise to all our thoughts, behaviors and emotions. He also explains how to explore and address the root causes of anxiety, low confidence, negative internal narratives, over-thinking and how our unconscious defense mechanisms operate. This episode provides a foundational roadmap to assess your sense of self and mental health. It offers tools to reshape negative emotions, thought patterns and behaviors — either through self-exploration or with a licensed professional. The subsequent three episodes in this special series explore additional tools to further understand and improve your mental health.",https://hubermanlab.com/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-understand-and-assess-your-mental-health/,https://hubermanlab.com/dr-paul-conti-therapy-treating-trauma-and-other-life-challenges; https://hubermanlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/The-Iceberg-Model.pdf; https://hubermanlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Pillars-of-Mental-Health.pdf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=226s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=415s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=641s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=973s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=1221s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=1575s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=1887s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=2161s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=2247s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=2780s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=3192s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=3584s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=3964s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=4281s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=4652s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=4980s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=5414s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=5690s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=6041s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=6302s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=7135s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=7497s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=8033s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=8493s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=8658s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=9180s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=9740s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=10186s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=10538s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=10970s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=11372s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=12002s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=12366s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=12933s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4&t=13241s,"00:00:00 Dr. Paul Conti; 00:03:46 Sponsors: BetterHelp & Waking Up; 00:06:55 What is a Healthy Self?; 00:10:41 Agency & Gratitude; Empowerment & Humility; 00:16:13 Physical Health & Mental Health Parallels; 00:20:21 Structure of Self; Unconscious vs. Conscious Mind; “Iceberg”; 00:26:15 Defense Mechanisms; Character Structure “Nest”, Sense of Self; 00:31:27 Predispositions & Character Structure; 00:36:01 Sponsor: AG1; 00:37:27 Character Structure & Action States; Physical Health Parallels; 00:46:20 Anxiety; Understanding Excessive Anxiety; 00:53:12 Improving Confidence: State Dependence & Phenomenology; Narcissism; 00:59:44 Changing Beliefs & Internal Narratives; 01:06:04 Individuality & Addressing Mental Health Challenges; 01:11:21 Mental Health Goals & Growth; 01:17:32 Function of Self; 01:23:00 Defense Mechanisms: Projection, Displacement; 01:30:14 Projection, Displacement, Projective Identification; 01:34:50 Humor, Sarcasm, Cynicism; 01:40:41 Attention & Salience; Negative Internal Dialogue; 01:45:02 Repetition Compulsion & Defense Mechanism, Trauma; 01:58:55 Mirror Meditation & Self Awareness; Structure & Function of Self, “Cupboards”; 02:04:57 Pillars of the Mind, Agency & Gratitude, Happiness; 02:13:53 Generative Drive, Aggressive & Pleasure Drives; 02:21:33 Peace, Contentment & Delight, Generative Drive; Amplification; 02:24:18 Generative Drive, Amplification & Overcoming; 02:33:00 Over-Thinking, Procrastination, Choices; 02:42:20 Aggressive, Pleasure & Generative Drives, Envy; 02:49:46 Envy, Destruction, Mass Shootings; 02:55:38 Demoralization, Isolation, Low Aggressive Drive; 03:02:50 Demoralization, Affiliate Defense; 03:09:32 Strong Aggressive Drive, Competition, Generative Drive Reframing; 03:20:02 Cultivating a Generative Drive, Spirited Inquiry of the “Cupboards”; 03:26:06 Current Mental Health Care & Medications; 03:35:33 Role of Medicine in Exploration; 03:40:41 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter"

c0e1b8c6-c278-4100-a94f-f7dd9b01d01b,"Ketamine: Benefits and Risks for Depression, PTSD & Neuroplasticity","In this episode, I explain how ketamine causes rewiring of brain circuits and dissociative states to relieve symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). I explain how ketamine impacts both the brain’s glutamate and its endogenous opioid pathways, which together regulate mood and well-being. I discuss how ketamine therapy is used clinically to treat major depression, bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), suicidality and other psychiatric challenges. I also describe how ketamine causes the subjective effects of dissociation and euphoria and, at higher doses, is an anesthetic. I compare the different routes of ketamine administration, dosages and forms of ketamine, and if micro-dosing ketamine is effective. I also highlight the potential risks of recreational ketamine use (and the colloquial term ‘K-holes’).

We discuss how to cope and grow through uncertain situations, especially those that force us to reexamine our roles and identity. Dr. Shankar shares her experience of redefining her identity after an early career-ending setback. She also explains numerous science-based strategies to effectively define goals, structure our goal pursuits and maintain consistent motivation.

d7601ecc-7413-46c0-b3c4-0e6f884041c6,How to Enhance Performance & Learning by Applying a Growth Mindset,"In this episode, I discuss how to build and apply a growth mindset — the practice of self-rewarding and focusing on learning and skill development through effort — to improve learning and performance. I also discuss how our internal narratives drive our ability to make progress. I contrast the growth mindset vs. the fixed mindset and describe how the type of feedback or praise we receive shapes our mindsets, and the huge advantage of rewarding and celebrating “verbs” (actions) rather than adjectives (performance labels). I also discuss data showing how stress can enhance performance and explain why the growth mindset works synergistically with the “stress-is-enhancing mindset,” and how to combine them. Whether you are a student, coach, therapist, parent, teacher or simply someone seeking to improve at something, this episode provides numerous science-supported tools for how to adopt a performance enhancing mindset.",https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-enhance-performance-and-learning-by-applying-a-growth-mindset/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=175s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=317s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=778s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=1210s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=1605s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=1733s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=1950s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=2076s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=2141s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=2408s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=3028s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=3263s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=3330s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=3953s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=4401s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=4836s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=5145s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=5297s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=5484s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=5578s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=5675s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=5960s,"00:00:00 Growth Mindset; 00:02:55 Sponsors: Eight Sleep & ROKA; 00:05:17 Mindset & Narrative; 00:12:58 Intelligence Feedback vs. Effort Feedback, Identity Labels; 00:20:10 Intelligence vs. Effort Praise: Performance, Persistence & Self-Representation; 00:26:45 Fixed Intelligence vs. Growth Mindset; 00:28:53 Tool: Intelligence (Performance) vs. Effort Narrative, Labels; 00:32:30 Tool: Failure & Identity; Effort & Verbs; 00:34:36 Sponsor: AG1; 00:35:41 Tool: Timing, Intelligence vs. Effort Praise & Performance; 00:40:08 Fixed Mindset vs. Growth Mindset: Failure & Performance; 00:50:28 Tool: Shift from Fixed Mindset; 00:54:23 Sponsor: InsideTracker; 00:55:30 Stress-is-Enhancing Mindset; 01:05:53 How Stress Can Enhance Performance; 01:13:21 Growth Mindset + Stress-is-Enhancing Mindset & Performance; 01:20:36 Reframing Stress; 01:25:45 Tool 1: Student & Teacher Mindset; 01:28:17 Tool 2: Effort Praise/Feedback: Verbs not Labels; 01:31:24 Tool 3: Errors & Seeking Help; 01:32:58 Tool 4: Self-Teaching & Growth Mindset; 01:34:35 Tool 5: Reframe “Mind is Like a Muscle” Analogy; 01:39:20 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter"

We discuss the brain’s several reward systems involving dopamine and serotonin and how these motivate us to seek out specific behaviors and substances. We discuss how these reward systems are modified based on context and our memories, and how they can be hijacked toward maladaptive drug seeking in addiction. We also explore how reward systems influence social connections, oxytocin and empathy and how that applies to our understanding of autism spectrum disorders. This episode should be of interest to those interested in neuroplasticity, social bonding, addiction, autism, learning and motivation.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-robert-malenka-how-your-brains-reward-circuits-drive-your-choices/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=157s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=321s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=691s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=1054s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=1538s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=1850s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=2404s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=3051s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=3470s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=3818s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=3891s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=4360s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=4769s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=5430s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=5908s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=6193s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=6737s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=7339s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=7807s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=8243s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=8893s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=9438s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=9616s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=10077s,"00:00:00 Dr. Robert Malenka; 00:02:37 Sponsors: ROKA & Levels; 00:05:21 Dopamine & Reward Circuitry; 00:11:31 Reward, Arousal, Memory & Dopamine; 00:17:34 Context, Cues & Dopamine Modification; 00:25:38 Memory & Reward Scaling; 00:30:50 Dopamine, “Addictive Liability” & Route of Administration 00:39:07 Sponsor: AG1; 00:40:04 Drugs of Abuse & Brain Changes; Addiction & Individual Variability; 00:50:51 Reinforcement vs. Reward, Wanting vs. Liking; 00:57:50 Opioids, Psychostimulants & Dopamine; 01:03:38 Sponsor: LMNT; 01:04:51 Self-Doubt, Confidence & Career; 01:12:40 Autism Spectrum Disorder; 01:19:29 Pro-Social Interaction & Reward; Oxytocin, Serotonin & Dopamine; 01:30:30 Nucleus Accumbens & Behavior Probability; 01:38:28 Reward for Pro-Social Behavior; 01:43:13 Social Media & “Addictive Liability”; Gambling; 01:52:17 Pain, Social Behavior & Empathy; 02:02:19 Empathy Circuitry, Dopamine & Serotonin; 02:10:07 Autism Spectrum Disorder & Social Interactions, Empathy; 02:17:23 MDMA, Serotonin & Dopamine; Addiction & Pro-Social Effects; 02:28:13 Autism Spectrum Disorder, Social Behavior, MDMA & Pharmacology; 02:37:18 Serotonin, MDMA & Psychedelics; 02:40:16 Psychedelics: Research & Therapeutic Potential; 02:47:57 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter"

I discuss the neuronal mechanisms for how MDMA elevates mood, empathy, motivation, social engagement, and reduces “threat detection” and how these effects can synergistically support talk therapy. I also explain the ongoing debate about the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA, myths about the origins and treatments for post-MDMA “crash,” the evolving legal landscape around MDMA use for clinical purposes, and I caution recreational users about the extremely dangerous additives (e.g., fentanyl) now commonly found in black market MDMA.

He is one of leading researchers in the study of how psychedelics such as psilocybin, LSD and DMT can change the human brain and in doing so, be used to successfully treat various mental health challenges such as major depression, anorexia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and addiction. He explains how psilocybin induces sustained changes in adaptive brain wiring and cognition. We discuss the key components of safe and effective psychedelic journeys, the role of hallucinations, the use of eye-masks to encourage people to “go internal,” and music, as well as what effective therapist support consists of before, during and after the session (also known as integration). We discuss micodosing vs. macrodosing and how researchers control for placebo effects in psychedelic research. We also discuss the current legal landscape around psychedelic therapies. Psychedelic therapies are fast emerging as powerful and soon-to-be mainstream treatments for medical health disorders, but they are not without their risks.

I discuss the emerging clinical trial evidence for the use of psilocybin in the treatment of depression, addictions and other psychiatric challenges. I explain the typical duration and phases of a psilocybin journey, the different categories of dosages often used and I explain the importance of set, setting and support when using psychedelics. I explain which groups of people place themselves at great risk by taking psilocybin as well as groups that could benefit, and I highlight the rapidly changing legal and medical landscape around psilocybin.

94733ea5-131f-496e-9508-b61e12bb96e2,"Dr. Noam Sobel: How Smells Influence Our Hormones, Health & Behavior","In this episode, my guest is Noam Sobel, PhD, professor of neurobiology in the department of brain sciences at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Dr. Sobel explains his lab’s research on the biological mechanisms of smell (“olfaction”) and how sensing odorants and chemicals in our environment impacts human behavior, cognition, social connections, and hormones. He explains how smell is a crucial component of “social sensing” and how we use olfaction when meeting new people to determine things about their physiology and psychology, and he explains how this impacts friendships and romantic partners. He explains how smell influences emotions, hormone levels, memories and the relationship between breathing and autonomic homeostasis. He describes how smell-based screening tests can aid disease diagnosis and explains his lab’s work on digitization of smell — which may soon allow online communication to include “sending of odors” via the internet.

f0027fb4-ee29-4bc2-8572-2a47a50cbc09,"The Science of Healthy Hair, Hair Loss and How to Regrow Hair","In this episode, I explain the biology of hair, hair growth, why hair growth slows and what causes hair to stop growing and/or “fall out.” I discuss the essential role of hair stem cells and other supporting biological factors for healthy hair growth. Then I describe various approaches (mechanical and chemical) to slow hair loss by increasing blood flow to hair stem cells, including minoxidil, tadalafil, PRP, microneedling, Botox and ketoconazole treatments. I also discuss how age-related hormone changes cause hair loss and explain the effectiveness of treatments such as caffeine, saw palmetto, growth hormone, finasteride and dutasteride. For all hair growth options, I describe potential side effects, how soon to expect results and the amount of hair regrowth to expect and I highlight effective combination treatments for hair regrowth even in hair “dead” (bald) zones. For many listeners, thinning, brittle hair, or pattern baldness are a source of anxiety and stress. This episode explains the mechanisms underlying hair regrowth tools and the science behind them so that you can evaluate potential treatments and associated side-effect profiles and select the best one(s) for you.

Dr. Panda explains how TRE, and also longer fasts, can positively impact obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, age-related chronic diseases, and improve mood and cognitive performance. He also describes how the timing of eating, light exposure and exercise that ~50% of all people engage in, negatively impacts their health and explains how specific simple adjustments to these can positively shift their subjective feelings of health and biomarkers of cardiovascular function, glucose regulation and metabolism.

d29abff8-b2eb-472f-bf9f-74524d024584,How to Optimize Your Water Quality & Intake for Health,"In this episode, I discuss our body’s most vital and essential nutrient—water. I explain the structure of water and how it is used by the cells and tissues of our body, how much water we each need to drink and when in order to optimize our mental focus and physical performance; and I include how exercise, humidity, heat, and caffeine affect our hydration needs. I explain how temperature and pH influence water’s physical properties and if there is any scientific basis for drinking so-called “pH water” or “alkalized water” to improve health. I explain how to test your tap water for contaminants (e.g., endocrine disruptors) and the documented problems with fluoride in drinking water. I provide options for filtering drinking water and describe different water types (e.g., reverse osmosis, hydrogen-enriched, electrolyzed reduced, deuterium depleted, etc.). Since the human body is mostly water (55-80% depending on one’s age) and water has essential roles in health, disease and cellular function, everyone ought to benefit from understanding how best to clean our tap water, hydrate effectively and in some cases, adjust the type of water we drink to allow our brain and body to function optimally in regard to health and performance. Note: The Huberman Lab podcast and Dr. Huberman have no affiliation with any brands or Amazon vendors related to water filters or tests. Those listed at the URLs below are meant merely as comparative samples of price range options (~50-$500 depending on volume of water they hold; whole home system of ~$1,000).

We discuss his research challenging long-held tenets of genetic inheritance and the relevance of those findings to understanding key biological and psychological processes including metabolism, stress and trauma. He describes the history of the scientific exploration of the “heritability of acquired traits” and how epigenetics and RNA biology can account for some of the passage of certain experience-based memories. He discusses the importance of model organisms in scientific research and describes his work on how stressors and memories can be passed through small RNA molecules to multiple generations of offspring in ways that meaningfully affect their behavior. Nature vs. nurture is a commonly debated theme; Dr. Rechavi’s work represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of that debate, as well as genetic inheritance, brain function and evolution.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-oded-rechavi-genes-and-the-inheritance-of-memories-across-generations/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=128s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=364s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=876s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=1374s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=1732s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=1806s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=2251s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=2713s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=3043s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=3546s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=4143s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=4220s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=4910s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=5162s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=5653s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=5921s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=6470s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=7176s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=7488s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=7882s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=8276s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=8966s,"00:00:00 Dr. Oded Rechavi; 00:02:08 ROKA, HVMN, Eight Sleep; 00:06:04 DNA, RNA, Protein; Somatic vs. Germ Cells; 00:14:36 Lamarckian Evolution, Inheritance of Acquired Traits; 00:22:54 Paul Kammerer & Toad Morphology; 00:28:52 AG1 (Athletic Greens); 00:30:06 James McConnell & Memory Transfer; 00:37:31 Weismann Barrier; Epigenetics; 00:45:13 Epigenetic Reprogramming; Imprinted Genes; 00:50:43 Nature vs. Nurture; Epigenetics & Offspring; 00:59:06 Generational Epigenetic Inheritance; 01:09:03 InsideTracker; 01:10:20 Model Organisms, C. elegans; 01:21:50 C. elegans & Inheritance of Acquired Traits, Small RNAs; 01:26:02 RNA Interference, C. elegans & Virus Immunity; 01:34:13 RNA Amplification, Multi-Generational Effects; 01:38:41 Response Duration & Environment; 01:47:50 Generational Memory Transmission, RNA; 01:59:36 Germ Cells & Behavior; Body Cues; 02:04:48 Transmission of Sexual Choice; 02:11:22 Fertility & Human Disease; 3-Parent In Vitro Fertilization (IVF); RNA Testing; 02:17:56 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Learning & Memory; 02:29:26 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter"

I discuss the positive benefits of breathing properly for mood, to reduce psychological and physiological stress, to halt sleep apnea, and improve facial aesthetics and immune system function. I also compare what is known about the effects and effectiveness of different breathing techniques, including physiological sighs, box breathing and cyclic hyperventilation, “Wim Hof Method,” Prānāyāma yogic breathing and more. I also describe how to breath to optimize learning, memory and reaction time and I explain breathing at high altitudes, why “overbreathing” is bad, and how to breathe specifically to relieve cramps and hiccups. Breathwork practices are zero-cost and require minimal time yet provide a unique and powerful avenue to improve overall quality of life that is grounded in clear physiology.

He explains protocols to improve the various kinds of physical endurance: muscular endurance, anerobic capacity, maximum aerobic output, and long duration endurance. He also explains how the body uses different energy sources (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) during rest and exercise. He also explains the mechanisms underlying fat loss and how and why exercise accelerates rates of fat loss. We cover the many concepts related to endurance training and fat loss such as metabolic flexibility, breathwork training for exercise performance and recovery, lactate production and regulation, how to improve blood flow to muscles, anaerobic vs. aerobic metabolism, exercise fatigue, low-carbohydrate diets and fat loss, and how to combine different types of workouts to improve overall endurance. This episode in intended for everyone ranging from novice and recreational exercisers to elite endurance athletes.

He is also the author of a new book, “The Creative Act: A Way of Being,” which explores the creative process and how to access creativity. We discuss topics such as finding inspiration, the role of feelings as guideposts, learning from observing nature, balancing self-doubt and anxiety, and adopting new perspectives to channel the creative process. Rick also shares his thoughts on using deadlines, eliminating distractions, and how our experiences and emotions influence the creative process. Additionally, we discuss his love for professional wrestling.

5373b9a9-8939-4600-b18c-b4e393fe2a83,Developing a Rational Approach to Supplementation for Health & Performance,"In this episode, I explain how to design a supplementation protocol to support maximum mental and physical health and performance depending on your specific needs, nutrition, lifestyle and finances. When most people hear about “supplements,” they think they are vitamin supplements, but there are many compounds that are powerful and sold over-the-counter that can enhance our health in performance and that can’t be obtained from foods. First, I discuss “foundational” supplements to support overall health, including water and fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, adaptogens, and prebiotics/probiotics. Then I explain how to use single-ingredient supplements to enhance specific aspects of your physiology, such as aiding sleep, cognitive enhancement, and focus supporting healthy hormone levels (e.g., testosterone, estrogen and growth hormone, thyroid). Finally, I explain when it makes sense to add supplements to your lifestyle and discuss how best to use supplements, including how to determine dosage, sourcing, continuous schedules and cycling, and how to layer different supplements most effectively. This episode will explain how to design the safest, most biologically effective, cost-effective supplementation protocol to meet your particular goals and support your overall health, including vitality and longevity.",https://hubermanlab.com/developing-a-rational-approach-to-supplementation-for-health-and-performance/,https://examine.com,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=218s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=711s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=938s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=1267s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=1525s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=1684s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=1986s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=2159s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=2204s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=2315s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=2625s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=3052s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=3355s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=3491s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=3765s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=3833s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=4139s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=4368s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=4564s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=4986s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=5244s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=5454s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=5817s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=5935s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=6238s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=6445s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=6609s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=6925s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=7116s,"00:00:00 Supplements; 00:03:38 Hierarchy of Tools/Interventions, Developing a Supplementation Protocol; 00:11:51 Momentous, LMNT, Helix Sleep; 00:15:38 Role of Supplements, Foundational Supplements, Water/Fat-Soluble Vitamins; 00:21:07 Supplement Considerations: Cost, Nutrition & Schedule; 00:25:25 Foundational Supplements, Digestive Enzymes, Adaptogens; 00:28:04 Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition; 00:33:06 Supplements for Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog; 00:35:59 InsideTracker; 00:36:44 Adaptogens & Broad-Spectrum Foundational Supplements; 00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs; 00:43:45 Supplements to Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine; 00:50:52 Supplements for Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin; 00:55:55 Melatonin Caution; 00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects; 01:02:45 AG1 (Athletic Greens); 01:03:53 Nutrition & Behavior for Hormone Health; 01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root; 01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions; 01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork; 01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido; 01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility; 01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine; 01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine; 01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements; 01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids; 01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein; 01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements; 01:55:25 A Rational Supplementation Protocol; 01:58:36 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter"
1259a8ca-fcf1-47e7-a9c0-64d5fe9ae707,"Dr. Sam Harris: Using Meditation to Focus, View Consciousness & Expand Your Mind","My guest is Sam Harris, Ph.D. Sam earned his bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Stanford University and his doctorate (Ph.D.) in neuroscience from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He is the author of multiple best-selling books and is a world-renowned public-facing intellectual on meditation, consciousness, free will, psychedelics and neuroscience. He is also the creator of Waking Up and the host of the Making Sense podcast. In this episode, we discuss meditation as a route to understanding “the self” and experiencing consciousness, not just changing one’s conscious state. Sam describes several meditation techniques and their benefits, including how meditation fundamentally changes our worldview and how it can be merged seamlessly into daily life. It can help us overcome universal challenges such as distractibility and persistent, internal dialogue (“chatter”) to allow for deep contentment and pervasive shifts in our awareness, all while acknowledging the more immediate stress-lowering and memory-improving effects of meditation. We also discuss the therapeutic use of psychedelics and the mechanistic similarities between the benefits of a psychedelic journey and long-term meditation practices. And we discuss the rationale behind Sam’s recent decision to close his social media (Twitter) account.

We discuss how people can build and sculpt their identity and psychology through specific mindsets and actions and how to adapt the self to novel and challenging situations, using specific daily routines. We consider how “energy” actually stems from physical action and describe practical tools and scientific mechanisms for leveraging exercise, cold exposure, nutrition, fasting, hydration, sunlight, mindset and music to make us feel more energized and what that, in turn, does for our life. Jocko explains how discipline and specific daily routines allow for productivity and creativity. And we discuss the qualities of successful leaders, including how to build confidence and real bonds when working with a team or family/friends. Jocko describes a particularly powerful tool of using perspective shifts to allow for ‘detachment’- as a unique way to identify novel solutions to problems. We also discuss the power of early developmental narratives and how experiences of friendship, love, connection and loss can serve as pillars for making us better human beings in all aspects of life. Our conversation covers a wide range of topics, including mental health, physical health and performance, and provides actionable tools that anyone, regardless of age or profession, can apply to live a more effective and meaningful life.",https://hubermanlab.com/jocko-willink-how-to-become-resilient-forge-your-identity-and-lead-others/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=230s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=522s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=1151s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=1502s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=1774s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=2139s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=2213s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=3130s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=3545s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=4327s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=4391s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=5041s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=5564s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=6310s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=6845s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=7740s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=8103s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=8430s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=9043s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=9618s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=10220s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=10555s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=11311s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=11869s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=12181s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=12422s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=13156s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=13341s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=13885s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=14498s,"00:00:00 Jocko Willink; 00:03:50 Maui Nui Venison, Eight Sleep, LMNT, Momentous; 00:08:42 Sense of Self, Discovery & Autonomy; 00:19:11 Mindsets in the Military: Garrison vs. Combat; 00:25:02 Military Divisions; 00:29:34 Daily Workouts & Discipline; 00:35:39 AG1 (Athletic Greens); 00:36:53 Energy & Movement, Cortisol, Nutrition; 00:52:10 Exercise & Energy, Deliberate Cold Exposure; 00:59:05 Win vs. Loss Mindset, Leadership, Action & Energy; 01:12:07 InsideTracker; 01:13:11 Confidence, Generators vs. Projectors, Family; 01:24:01 Restoring Motivation: Social Connection & Play; 01:32:44 Self-Identity & Context, Alcohol, Music, Dopamine; 01:45:10 Motivation Sources & Recovering from Loss; 01:54:05 Suicide, Navy SEALs, Social Contagion; 02:09:00 Suicide, Alcohol, Positive Action; 02:15:03 Meditation, Detachment; 02:20:30 Adaptability & Opportunities, Navy SEALs; 02:30:43 Ambition & Love, Likeability, Leadership; 02:40:18 Building Teams, Detachment, Family; 02:50:20 Detachment: Problems & Perspective; 02:55:55 Tools: Strategies to Detach from Situation; 03:08:31 Tool: Situational Awareness & Detachment; 03:17:49 Social Media, Personal Flaws; 03:23:01 Falling Asleep & Detachment; 03:27:02 Resilience Calibration, Navy SEAL Training & Combat; 03:39:16 Deliberate Discomfort & Mental Resilience; 03:42:21 People & Animals, Personalities; 03:51:25 Political Leadership & Military, Social Media; 04:01:38 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media"

I discuss how convergent and divergent thinking are essential for generating creative ideas and provide three types of meditation tools (open monitoring meditation, focused attention meditation & non-sleep deep rest; NSDR), which improve our ability to engage in these creative thinking patterns in specific and powerful ways. I also discuss how dopamine and mood contribute to the creative process and describe behavioral, nutritional and supplementation-based approaches for increasing dopamine to engage in creative thought and implementation. I explain how movement and storytelling (narrative) approaches can generate novel creative ideas and how substances like alcohol, cannabis, and psilocybin impact our creative ability.

I explain how caffeine powerfully reinforces the consumption of certain foods and drinks—thereby increasing how much we like their tastes and seek them out. I discuss the mechanisms by which caffeine increases focus, alertness and mood and reduces sleepiness. I also explain many practical tools for caffeine use, including delaying caffeine intake after waking, intermittent caffeine use, during fasting, before and during exercise, and the use of theanine to curb jitters caused by caffeine. I also discuss the positive effects of caffeine on overall health and longevity and address several myths about caffeine.

He explains the important connection between nutrition, metabolism and mental health and his pioneering work using the ketogenic diet to successfully treat patients with various mental illnesses, including depression and schizophrenia. Dr. Palmer explains how the ketogenic diet is an evidenced-based treatment for epilepsy, mimics the fasted state and can offset the cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s. He describes the key roles of mitochondria in mental health, how certain conditions likely arise from mitochondrial dysfunction, and how low-carbohydrate diets increase mitochondrial turnover to improve mental health. He also explains how low-carbohydrate diets positively impact the gut microbiome and weight loss, important risk factors for mitochondrial health such as marijuana and alcohol, and the best way to increase circulating ketones depending on individual needs. We also cover how a ketogenic diet impacts mood, sleep, and fertility. Dr. Palmer’s work stands as a revolutionary approach to mental health and disease that, given the prevalence of mental health challenges, should be of interest to people of all backgrounds and ages.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-chris-palmer-diet-nutrition-for-mental-health/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=205s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=438s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=1243s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=1672s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=2072s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=2138s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=2555s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=2811s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=3370s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=3425s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=3944s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=4512s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=4583s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=5109s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=5514s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=6000s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=6394s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=6921s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=7265s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=7587s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=7816s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=8625s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=9347s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=9997s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=10343s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=10861s,"00:00:00 Dr. Chris Palmer, Mental Health & Metabolic Disorders; 00:03:25 Thesis, Eight Sleep, ROKA; 00:07:18 Nutrition & Mental Health; 00:20:43 Low-Carb Diets & Anti-Depression, Fasting, Ketosis; 00:27:52 Schizophrenia, Depression & Ketogenic Diet; 00:34:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens); 00:35:38 Psychiatric Mediations, Diet Adherence; 00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits; 00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment; 00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health; 00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits for Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders; 01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health; 01:15:12 InsideTracker; 01:16:23 Mitophagy, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Aging & Diet; 01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose; 01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria; 01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana; 01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet; 01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones; 02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet; 02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose; 02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet; 02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss; 02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep; 02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility; 02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications; 03:01:01 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media"

I review how specific types of human connection and attention to our choices (or lack thereof) can increase or undermine our level of happiness. I also discuss the importance of certain types of physical contact, gratitude, financial choices and volunteer contributions that research shows can maximize happiness.

8f12c52b-2c7f-4de3-9eba-7b224838c949,How Meditation Works & Science-Based Effective Meditations,"In this episode, I discuss the biological mechanisms of the state changes that occur during different types of meditation and describe how to develop the meditation practice optimal for you. I explain key meditation principles, such as using specific breathwork patterns and adjusting your perception to specific locations along the continuum between interoception, exteroception and dissociation. I discuss how meditation practices lead to long-term trait changes and neuroplasticity, including changing your default mood, reducing baseline anxiety/depression, increasing your ability to focus, enhancing relaxation, improving sleep, and increasing your overall happiness level.  I also explain the concept behind the “third-eye center,” what mindfulness is from a biological standpoint, the power of ultra-brief meditations and how to select the best meditation and time and duration to meditate to meet your need. I also explain a novel open-eyed perception-based meditation that may enhance focus, relaxation and task-switching ability.

I discuss fundamentals of resistance training protocols, including repetitions, sets, inter-set and inter-workout rest periods and periodization of intensity and volume to improve strength and hypertrophy. I also explain how to integrate this with endurance training across the week by controlling the duration, timing and intensity of cardiovascular workouts. I also cover science-based protocols on leveraging the mind-body connection, deliberate breathing (during and after exercise), stretching, deliberate heat and cold exposure, and non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) for better workout performance and faster recovery. Further, I tackle a range of real-world issues that can affect a consistent training schedule, such as whether you should train if you are sick, have had a poor night of sleep or had a stressful event and how to start training again after a break and whether you should train in a fasted or fed state. Physical fitness is a key variable for immediate and long-term health.

4f1602d9-c8fe-4c65-a01a-bb0648117a92,The Effects of Cannabis (Marijuana) on the Brain & Body,"In this episode, I discuss cannabis (aka marijuana), including the biological mechanisms underlying its effects on the mind and body, its known medical applications, its impact on libido, creativity, hunger, hormones and more. I also cover the known adverse health consequences of chronic and even acute (one-time) use and the factors that determine if cannabis is helpful or harmful. Additionally, I detail how the various strains of cannabis: sativa, indica and hybrid strains, can produce such divergent effects depending on the strain type, THC-to-CBD ratio, total dosage, and frequency of use. I review why cannabis can impact speech patterns and one’s propensity to develop anxiety/depression during and after use and, in some individuals, paranoia. As the legal landscape for cannabis is rapidly evolving, this episode should interest a wide audience, including former/current cannabis users, those in the medical, sports, law enforcement, and educational communities and, of course, children, teenagers, and parents.",https://hubermanlab.com/the-effects-of-cannabis-marijuana-on-the-brain-and-body/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=286s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=423s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=608s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=841s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=908s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=1174s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=1555s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=1841s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=1916s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=2435s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=2594s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=3187s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=3389s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=3898s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=4181s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=4568s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=5201s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=5708s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=6406s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=7015s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=7613s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=7806s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=8293s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=8757s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=9276s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=9704s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=9894s,"00:00:00 Cannabis (Marijuana); 00:04:46 New: Huberman Lab Premium Membership; 00:07:03 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Sleep & Anxiety; 00:10:08 Levels, Thesis, InsideTracker; 00:14:01 Momentous Supplements; 00:15:08 Cannabis Strains, Psychoactive Compounds: THC & CBD; 00:19:34 Sativa vs. Indica, Stimulant vs. Relaxation Effects; 00:25:55 Hybrid Cannabis Strains, Type 1, 2 & 3 Strains; 00:30:41 AG1 (Athletic Greens); 00:31:56 Naturally Occurring Receptors: Nicotinic & Cannabinoid Receptors (CB1); 00:40:35 THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence; 00:43:14 Endogenous Cannabinoids, Cannabinoid Receptors & Nervous System Function; 00:53:07 Biological Effects of Cannabis; 00:56:29 Cannabis Sativa & Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia; 01:04:58 Cannabis Indica & Subjective Effects, Memory, Dosage; 01:09:41 Brain Areas Affected by THC & CBD, Side Effects; 01:16:08 Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking & Dopamine; 01:26:41 Does Cannabis Increase Creativity?; 01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes in Speech Patterns; 01:46:46 Cannabis & Libido, Dopamine & Prolactin; 01:56:55 Cannabis & Hormones: Prolactin, Testosterone, Estrogen & Fertility; 02:06:53 Smoking/Vaping Tobacco or Cannabis & Negative Health Consequences; 02:10:06 Avoiding Cannabis During Pregnancy/Breastfeeding, Fetal Neural Development; 02:18:13 Negative Health Consequences of Cannabis, Anxiety & Depression, Tolerance; 02:25:57 Cannabis Use & Adolescence/Young Adulthood, Predisposition to Psychosis; 02:34:36 Adolescent Cannabis Use: Brain Development & Mental Health Disorders; 02:41:44 Cannabis & Pain Management, Divergent Effects of Cannabis; 02:44:54 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Premium Channel, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn"
72653dc7-1cca-4e17-8695-15b73d0f4fd6,Dr. Casey Halpern: Biology & Treatments for Compulsive Eating & Behaviors,"My guest is Casey Halpern, M.D., Chief of Stereotactic and Functional and Professor of Neurosurgery at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Halpern’s research and clinical practice focus on using deep brain stimulation to treat compulsive and movement disorders (e.g., binge eating disorders, bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Parkinson’s disease essential tremor, dystonia). We discuss using deep brain stimulation to help patients who suffer from movement and compulsive disorders and applying this treatment to patients afflicted with binge eating. We also explore applications of this technology to other conditions such as OCD, anorexia and tremor, and the future therapeutic directions of the use of non-invasive brain stimulation approaches, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and ultrasound, for the treatment of other psychiatric illnesses and conditions.

a5b9b1a6-65c4-437d-8d00-ea9087a6fc98,Nicotine’s Effects on the Brain & Body & How to Quit Smoking or Vaping,"In this episode, I explain how nicotine impacts the brain and body, including its potent ability to enhance attention, focus, and alertness, increase blood pressure and metabolism and reduce appetite. I discuss nicotine’s ability to increase the action of neurochemicals, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine and activate sympathetic (alertness-promoting) neural circuits. I also discuss common nicotine delivery methods, such as cigarettes, vaping, dip, and snuff, and how they each create their own unique experience and how they, but not nicotine itself, cause cancer and other adverse health effects. I also explain science-based tools to permanently quit smoking cigarettes or vaping, including peer-reviewed clinical hypnosis tools, antidepressants, and alternative nicotine replacement (patches, lozenges, gums etc.).

Dr. Anderson is a Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a member of the National Academy of Sciences and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). We discuss how states of mind (and body) arise and persist and how they probably better explain human behavior than emotions per se. We also discuss the many kinds of arousal that create varying levels of pressure for certain behaviors to emerge. We discuss different types of violent aggression and how they are impacted by biological sex, gender, context, prior experience, and hormones, and the neural interconnectedness of fear, aggression and sexual behavior. We also discuss peptides and their role in social isolation-induced anxiety and aggression. Dr. Anderson also describes novel, potentially powerful therapeutics for mental health.

I explain science-supported strategies for transitioning into focus, maintaining focus during the work bout, and exiting the focus session, which is also critical, including decompression/defocusing tools. I explain when and how to use: binaural beats, caffeine, deliberate cold exposure, the pros and cons of working in fasted vs. fed states, and supplements and foods that enhance dopamine, epinephrine (i.e., adrenaline) and acetylcholine to promote optimal focus. Also, I explain how short behavioral practices, such as meditation and visual gaze training, will benefit your ability to focus over the long term. As deep focus is crucial to significantly improve cognitive or physical performance in any realm, this episode should be useful to anyone.

I also describe genetic differences that predispose certain individuals to alcoholism, binge and habit-drinking. I explain alcohol metabolism in simple terms and how it effectively acts as a poison, leading to cellular stress and damage. I then explain that it impacts neuronal function and changes our thinking and behavior – hallmarks of inebriation. I also discuss how alcohol consumption of different amounts impacts inflammation, stress, neurodegeneration, and cancer risk and negatively impacts the gut microbiome, brain thickness, hormone balance, mood and feelings of motivation. Additionally, I discuss the biology of hangovers and describe science-based strategies to mitigate the severity of a hangover. Since alcohol is one of the most widely consumed recreational substances, this episode ought to be of relevance to everyone.  Indeed, even low-to-moderate alcohol consumption negatively impacts the brain and body in direct ways. The goal of this episode is to help people make informed decisions about their alcohol consumption that are in keeping with their mental and physical health goals.",https://hubermanlab.com/what-alcohol-does-to-your-body-brain-health/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=145s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=199s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=412s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=646s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=808s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=1103s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=1463s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=1675s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=1807s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=2259s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=2693s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=2767s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=3147s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=3586s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=3764s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=3865s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=4331s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=4636s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=4845s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=5125s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=5616s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=5742s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=5831s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=6271s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=6414s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=6658s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=6909s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY&t=7115s,"00:00:00 Effects of Alcohol Consumption; 00:02:25 Momentous Supplements; 00:03:19 Low to Moderate Alcohol Consumption & Neurodegeneration; 00:06:52 Levels, Eight Sleep, ROKA; 00:10:46 Historical Context & Uses of Alcohol; 00:13:28 Alcohol Metabolism, “Empty Calories”; 00:18:23 Inebriation: Top-Down Inhibition, Impulsivity & Memory Formation; 00:24:23 Long-Lasting Effects & Impulsivity, Neuroplasticity & Reversibility; 00:27:55 Food & Alcohol Absorption; 00:30:07 Alcohol & Serotonin, SSRIs & Depression, Risk for Alcoholism, Blackouts; 00:37:39 Predisposition for Alcoholism; Chronic Consumption, Cortisol & Stress; 00:44:53 AG1 (Athletic Greens); 00:46:07 Genetic Predisposition for Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Too Young; 00:52:27 Gut-Liver-Brain Axis: Alcohol, Gut Microbiome, Inflammation & Leaky Gut; 00:59:46 Tool: Improving/Replenishing Gut Microbiome; 01:02:44 Reducing Alcohol Consumption & Stress; 01:04:25 Hangover: Alcohol & Sleep, Anxiety, Headache; 01:12:11 Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure; 01:17:16 Hangover Recovery, Dehydration & Electrolytes; 01:20:45 Types of Alcohol & Hangover Severity, Congeners; 01:25:25 Alcohol Tolerance, Dopamine & Serotonin, Pleasure-Pain Balance; 01:33:36 Are There Any Positive Effects of Alcohol?, Resveratrol; 01:35:42 Alcohol & Brain Thickness; 01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk; 01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins; 01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome; 01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance; 01:55:09 Negative Effects of Alcohol Consumption; 01:58:35 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter, Huberman Lab Clips"

4ff355ce-08a5-4948-952a-536172913261,The Science & Treatment of Bipolar Disorder,"In this episode, I explain the biology, symptoms, causes and types of bipolar disorder (sometimes called bipolar depression). I discuss neuroplasticity and how the brain normally regulates mood, energy, and perceptions; then, I contrast that with the biology of bipolar disorder, which is characterized by extremes of energy and mood, e.g., mania and depression. I outline the mechanisms through which bipolar disorder manifests in the brain, including deficits of interoception and reduced connections between the parietal and limbic systems. I also outline how treatment options (such as lithium) work in part through homeostatic plasticity.’ I discuss not only lithium but also the treatment of bipolar with ketamine, different talk therapies, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and nutraceuticals, including Omega-3 and Inositol supplementation. This episode should interest anyone who has or knows someone with bipolar disorder and, more broadly, those interested in how the brain works to create a balance between thoughts, energy levels, focus, and mood.",https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-treatment-of-bipolar-disorder/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=143s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=222s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=623s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=864s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=990s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=1738s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=1987s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=2300s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=2813s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=3111s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=3186s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=3764s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=3905s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=4210s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=4631s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=4978s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=5760s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=6198s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=6481s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=6710s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=7411s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=7604s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=8133s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=8265s,"00:00:00 Bipolar Disorder; 00:02:23 Momentous Supplements; 00:03:42 Tool: Appetite Suppression & GLP-1, Parallel Pathways, Yerba Mate; 00:10:23 InsideTracker, ROKA, Blinkist; 00:14:24 Prevalence & Severity of Bipolar Disorder; 00:16:30 Bipolar Disorder I, Diagnostic Criteria of Mania; 00:28:58 Bipolar Disorder II, Individual Variability; 00:33:07 Bipolar I vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States; 00:38:20 Consequences of Bipolar Disorder, Heritability; 00:46:53 Bipolar Disorder vs. Borderline Personality Disorder; 00:51:51 Mania & Depression, Negative Impacts; 00:53:06 History of Lithium Treatment; 01:02:44 Lithium Treatment & Side-Effects; 01:05:05 Effects of Lithium: BDNF, Anti-inflammatory & Neuroprotection; 01:10:10 Neural Circuits of Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity; 01:17:11 Neural States & Mania, Parietal Lobe & Limbic System; 01:22:58 Homeostatic Plasticity, Synaptic Scaling, Lithium & Ketamine; 01:36:00 Talk Therapies: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Family-Focused Therapy, Interpersonal & Social Rhythm Therapy; 01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS); 01:48:01 Psylocibin, Cannabis; 01:51:50 Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids; 02:03:31 Omega-3s, Membrane Fluidity & Neuroplasticity; 02:06:44 Mania, Creativity & Occupations; 02:15:33 Bipolar Disorder: Diagnosis, Neural Circuits & Treatment; 02:17:45 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter"
89519702-97b2-46a5-93ef-e126332b57fc,Dr. Charles Zuker: The Biology of Taste Perception & Sugar Craving,"My guest this episode is Dr. Charles Zuker, PhD, Professor of Biochemistry, Molecular Biophysics and Neuroscience at Columbia University and an Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). Dr. Zuker is the world’s leading expert in the biology of taste, thirst and craving. His laboratory explores the mechanisms of taste perception, focusing on how our conscious and unconscious processing of specific foods and nutrients guide our actions and behaviors. We discuss the neural circuits of taste,  the “gut-brain axis,” the basis of food cravings and the key difference between wanting (craving) and liking (perceiving) sugar. We also explore how taste perception relates to specific food satiety, thirst, to our emotions, and expectation. We also consider how sugar containing and highly-processed foods can hijack the natural balance of the taste and digestive systems. Dr. Zuker provides a true masterclass in the biology of taste and perception that ought to be of interest to anyone curious about how the brain works, our motivated behaviors and the neural, chemical perceptual aspects of the mind.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-charles-zuker-the-biology-of-taste-perception-and-sugar-craving/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=185s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=275s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=515s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=708s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=980s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=1219s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=1578s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=1680s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=1814s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=2042s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=2374s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=2574s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=3115s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=3376s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=3704s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=4154s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=4646s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=5045s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=5290s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=5783s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=6189s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=6723s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=6846s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=7050s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=7313s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=7838s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=8158s,"00:00:00 Dr. Charles Zuker & Taste Perception; 00:03:05 Momentous Supplements; 00:04:35 Thesis, ROKA, Helix Sleep; 00:08:35 Sensory Detection vs. Sensory Perception; 00:11:48 Individual Variations within Perception, Color; 00:16:20 Perceptions & Behaviors; 00:20:19 The 5 Taste Modalities; 00:26:18 Aversive Taste, Bitter Taste; 00:28:00 Survival-Based & Evolutionary Reasons for Taste Modalities, Taste vs. Flavor; 00:30:14 Additional Taste Modalities: Fat & Metallic Perception; 00:34:02 Tongue “Taste Map,” Taste Buds & Taste Receptors; 00:39:34 Burning Your Tongue & Perception; 00:42:54 The “Meaning” of Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence; 00:51:55 Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior; 00:56:16 Acquired Tastes, Conditioned Taste Aversion; 01:01:44 Olfaction (Smell) vs. Taste, Changing Tastes over One’s Lifetime; 01:09:14 Integration of Odor & Taste, Influence on Behavior & Emotion; 01:17:26 Sensitization to Taste, Internal State Modulation, Salt; 01:24:05 Taste & Saliva: The Absence of Taste; 01:28:10 Sugar & Reward Pleasure Centers; Gut-Brain Axis, Anticipatory Response; 01:36:23 Vagus Nerve; 01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis; 01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite; 01:54:06 Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis; 01:57:30 Nutrition, Gut-Brain Axis & Changes in Behavior; 02:01:53 Fast vs. Slow Signaling & Reinforcement, Highly Processed Foods; 02:10:38 Favorite Foods: Enjoyment, Sensation & Context; 02:15:58 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter"

2e4fd1df-f7ed-4039-b542-788c8b291275,The Science & Treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD),"In this episode, I explain the biology and psychology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)—a prevalent and debilitating condition. I also discuss the efficacy and mechanisms behind OCD treatments—both behavioral and pharmacologic as well as holistic and combination treatments and new emerging treatments, including directed brain stimulation. I explain the neural circuitry underlying repetitive “thought-action loops” and why in OCD, the compulsive actions merely make the obsessions even stronger. I review cognitive-behavioral therapies like exposure therapy and SSRIs, holistic approaches, and nutraceuticals, detailing the efficacy of each approach and what science says about how to combine and sequence treatments. I describe an often effective approach for treating OCD where clinicians use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to deliberately bring patients into states of high anxiety while encouraging them to suppress compulsive actions in order to help them learn to overcome repetitious thought/action cycles. This episode should interest anyone with OCD, anyone who knows someone with OCD or OCPD, and more generally, those interested in how the brain works to control thoughts and actions, whether those thoughts are intrusive or not.

Flexibility is crucial for physical movements and can help prevent injuries, decrease inflammation, modulate physical and mental pain, impact exercise recovery speed and even potentially slow the progression of certain diseases. I explain the biology of flexibility, including the specific neural mechanisms that sense stretch and load (i.e., tension) on the muscles and limbs, as well as how specific brain regions like the insula combine those signals to ultimately control limb range of movement. I also provide science-based stretching and “micro-stretching” protocols that reliably improve limb flexibility with the minimum necessary time investment. I review all the details of those stretching protocols: how often to do them, for how long, their timing relative to other exercises, sets, the time between sets, measuring progress and more. All people, physically active or not, should benefit from the information and tools described in this episode.

f8d7b646-c088-4bdf-baa3-df03489b3b84,The Science & Process of Healing from Grief,"This episode, I discuss grief and the challenges of processing losses of different kinds. I explain the biological mechanisms of grief, including how neural circuits for emotional and factual memory combine with those for love and attachment, to create feelings of absence and yearning. I discuss how grief is distinct from depression, yet why they can feel so similar. I also provide science-based tools to assist with the grieving process, including how to reframe and remap the relationship with those we have lost while still maintaining a strong emotional connection to them. I also explain the importance of having and building strong foundational psychological and biological states so that we can better cope with grief when it happens. Finally, I describe tools to adjust those states, including those for accessing sleep, managing stress and emotional swings. This episode is for those suffering from grief but also for everyone, given that we all experience grief at some point in our lives. We recorded this episode before the recent mass shooting tragedies in the United States. While we hope the information in this episode will be of use to anyone suffering from grief of any kind and at any time, we are also careful to acknowledge that many people require additional support and resources. For that reason, we include mention of such resources and we generally hope people will access them if needed.

I also describe tools that can be used to modulate the factors that have been shown to ‘prime’ an individual for aggression, including sunlight, estrogen sensitivity, competition within social settings, and overall stress levels, and the hormone cortisol. I discuss how substances such as caffeine and alcohol can impact impulsive behaviors and how nutrition and supplementation can be used to regulate mood and aggression.

26dd4930-eadb-4268-9b08-f537d4ff2994,Using Salt to Optimize Mental & Physical Performance,"I discuss the role of salt (sodium) in the nervous system and the key role that it plays in mental performance, physical performance and health. I explain how the brain senses salt levels in our body and how that relates to our feelings of thirst. I cover the physiology of the renal system and the hormones that control sodium and water balance in our body. I also explore how salt interacts with stress and our immune systems and its crucial role in neuron function. Additionally, I examine research findings suggesting that some individuals might benefit from increased intake of sodium and other electrolytes (magnesium and potassium) to enhance mental performance, lessen anxiety, and offset dizziness. Yet, other people may need less sodium. I discuss how you can determine your optimal sodium intake and why sodium intake levels need to be uniquely tailored to an individual’s lifestyle. Finally, I explain how salt creates ‘hidden’ sugars in many processed foods and the problems that can create.

Dr. Sonnenburg’s research focuses on how microbes in our gut impact our mental and physical health and how diet and your environment shape your gut microbiome. We discuss the architecture of the gut microbiome and microbiota variability in different regions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and how these can change in response to diet, environment or genetics. We explore the early establishment of your microbiome and how your mode of delivery into the world (C-section or not) shapes your gut. We also discuss lifestyle factors that can alter your microbiome and the integral role the gut microbiome plays in communicating to other organs, including your brain. Dr. Sonnenburg details his recent clinical study, which found that diets rich in fermented foods (but not fiber) increase microbiota diversity and reduce signals of inflammation. Additionally, we examine how foods typical in Western Diets (e.g., high fat, low fiber, processed foods) can negatively impact the gut microbiome. Throughout the episode, we discuss actionable tools from peer-reviewed clinical findings that anyone can implement, regardless of budget, in order to optimize their gut microbiome and health.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-justin-sonnenburg-how-to-build-maintain-and-repair-gut-health/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=175s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=256s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=510s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=769s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=960s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=1316s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=1590s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=1738s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=2110s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=2524s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=3079s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=3684s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=4023s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=4364s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=4490s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=4817s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=5533s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=6093s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=6300s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=6442s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=6615s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=7005s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=7170s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=7460s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=7620s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=7872s,"00:00:00 Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, Gut Microbiome; 00:02:55 The Brain Body Contract; 00:04:16 AG1 (Athletic Greens), ROKA, Helix Sleep; 00:08:30 What is the Gut Microbiome?; 00:12:49 Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract & Microbiota Variability; 00:16:00 Breast Feeding, C-Sections & Pets; 00:21:56 The Human Microbiome Project at Stanford; 00:26:30 Traditional vs. Industrialized Populations; 00:28:58 Resilience of the Microbiome; 00:35:10 Regional Differences Along Your GI Tract; 00:42:04 Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health; 00:51:19 Dietary Differences; 01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods; 01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners; 01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful?

Dr. Crum is a world expert on mindsets and beliefs and how they shape our responses to stress, exercise, and even to the foods we eat. Dr. Huberman and Dr. Crum discuss how our mindset about the nutritional content of food changes whether it is satisfying to us at a physiological (hormonal and metabolic) level. She also explains how mindsets about exercise can dramatically alter the effects of exercise on weight loss, blood pressure, and other health metrics. Dr. Crum teaches us how to think about stress in ways that allow stress to grow us and bring out our best rather than diminish our health and performance.

a6221fa2-b7b2-4609-9b3c-37da96971271,The Science of Making & Breaking Habits,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman reviews the science of habit formation and habit elimination and how the process of neuroplasticity (brain rewiring) underlies these processes. He describes two new systems for habit formation. The first system is grounded in the neuroscience of brain states and our ability to perform (and to avoid) certain tasks at different phases of the 24-hour day. The second system focuses on 21-day habit formation and consolidation. He also discusses “task bracketing” as an approach to enhancing habit formation and eliminating unwanted habits and the neural circuits that underlie task bracketing in the basal ganglia (a brain region for generating and stopping behaviors). Dr. Huberman also reviews the science of dopamine rewards and how to apply that knowledge to shaping habits. The science and tools in this episode ought to be helpful for anyone looking to build better habits and eliminate unwanted habits for school, work, fitness, relationships, creative endeavors, and more—indeed for any person or situation where behavioral changes are needed.",https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-making-and-breaking-habits/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=150s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=412s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=531s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=700s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=967s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=1135s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=1375s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=1443s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=1668s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=1860s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=2228s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=2296s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=2789s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=3324s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=3694s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=3897s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=4230s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=4702s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=5306s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=5749s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=5870s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=6266s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=6328s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=6507s,"00:00:00 Introducing Habits; New Programs; 00:02:30 Athletic Greens, InsideTracker, Helix Sleep; 00:06:52 Habits versus Reflexes, Learning, Neuroplasticity; 00:08:51 Goal-Based Habits vs. Identity-Based Habits; 00:11:40 How Long It (Really) Takes to Form a Habit; Limbic-Friction; 00:16:07 Linchpin Habits; 00:18:55 Mapping Your Habits; Habit Strength, Context-Dependence; 00:22:55 Automaticity; 00:24:03 Tool 1: Applying Procedural Memory Visualizations; 00:27:48 Hebbian Learning, NMDA receptors; 00:31:00 Tool 2: Task Bracketing; Dorsolateral Striatum; 00:37:08 States of Mind, Not Scheduling Time Predicts Habit Strength; 00:38:16 Tool 3: Phase-Based Habit Plan: Phase 1; 00:46:29 Tool 3: Phase-Based Habit Plan: Phase 2; 00:55:24 Tool 3: Phase-Based Habit Plan: Phase 3; 01:01:34 Habit Flexibility; 01:04:57 Should We Reward Ourselves?

He explains the neural and hormonal basis for “social homeostasis” (our drive for a given amount of socializing), which reveals why we get lonely, why we seek out connection with others and how power dynamics (hierarchies) shape those connections. Dr. Huberman also discusses the neurochemical basis of introversion and extroversion, of trust and how shared experiences that promote similar physiological states in two or more individuals lead to more rapid bonding. He also discusses how food and oxytocin play key roles in social bonding.

Dr. Berson discovered the neurons in your eye that set your biological rhythms for sleep, wakefulness, mood and appetite. He is also a world-renowned teacher of basic and advanced neuroscience, having taught thousands of university lectures on this topic. Many of his students have become world-leading neuroscientists and teachers themselves. Here Dr. Berson takes us on a structured journey into and around the nervous system, explaining: how we perceive the world and our internal landscape, how we balance, see, and remember. Also, how we learn and perform reflexive and deliberate actions, how we visualize and imagine in our mind, and how the various circuits of the brain coordinate all these incredible feats. Dr. Huberman and Dr. Berson discuss practical and real-life examples of neural circuit function across the lifespan. Dr. Berson gives us a masterclass in the nervous system—one that, in just less than two hours, will teach you an entire course’s worth about the brain and how yours works.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-david-berson-your-brains-logic-and-function/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=175s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=482s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=602s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=827s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=1016s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=1545s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=2085s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=2180s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=2463s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=3043s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=3603s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=3755s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=4244s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=4404s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=4595s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=5080s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=5613s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=5787s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=6320s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=6544s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=6620s,"00:00:00 Dr. David Berson; 00:02:55 Sponsors: Athletic Greens, InsideTracker, Magic Spoon; 00:08:02 How We See; 00:10:02 Color Vision; 00:13:47 “Strange” Vision; 00:16:56 How You Orient In Time; 00:25:45 Body Rhythms, Pineal function, Light & Melatonin, Blueblockers; 00:34:45 Spending Times Outdoors Improves Eyesight; 00:36:20 Sensation, Mood, & Self-Image; 00:41:03 Sense of Balance; 00:50:43 Why Pigeons Bob Their Heads, Motion Sickness; 01:00:03 Popping Ears; 01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight; 01:10:44 Why Tilted Motion Feels Good; 01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions; 01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & the “2 Marshmallow Test”; 01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex; 01:33:33 Neuroplasticity; 01:36:27 What is a Connectome?; 01:45:20 How to Learn (More About the Brain); 01:49:04 Book Suggestion, my Berson Appreciation; 01:50:20 Zero-Cost ways to Support the HLP, Guest Suggestions, Sponsors, Patreon, Thorne"
4b21e9ee-6757-451c-84e2-26bf643bce0a,Erasing Fears & Traumas Based on the Modern Neuroscience of Fear,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses fear and trauma, including the neural circuits involved in the “threat reflex” and how specific experiences and memories activate that system. He also discusses how our body is involved in trauma and fear. First, Dr. Huberman describes the logic of fear mechanisms and how “top-down” processing–meaning connections from the parts of the brain that assign meaning to our feelings, are involved in fear and erasing fears and traumas. Then he discusses what successful fear and trauma treatment must include and considers various treatments for whether they meet that standard, such as EMDR, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Ketamine, other drug-assisted therapies, and more. Dr. Huberman also reviews new data on how 5 minutes per day of deliberate, self-imposed stress can erase fear and depression. And he reviews the role that social connection plays in erasing or maintaining fears by activating specific molecular pathways in the brain and body. Finally, he reviews supplementation with over-the-counter compounds for their effects on anxiety and fear and when to take them, if at all.",https://hubermanlab.com/erasing-fears-and-traumas-based-on-the-modern-neuroscience-of-fear/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=135s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=409s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=705s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=824s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=1056s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=1704s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=1947s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=2158s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=2505s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=2770s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=3025s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=3476s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=3928s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=4440s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=4703s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=5100s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=5965s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=6376s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=6590s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=7182s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=7350s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=7800s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=7906s,"00:00:00 Introducing Fear, Trauma & Trauma; 00:02:15 Athletic Greens, InsideTracker, Helix Sleep; 00:06:49 What is Fear?; 00:11:45 Autonomic Arousal: “Alertness” vs. “Calmness”; 00:13:44 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis (HPA axis); 00:17:36 “The Threat Reflex”: Neural Circuits for Fear; 00:28:24 Controlling Fear: Top-Down Processing; 00:32:27 Narratives: “Protective or Dangerous”; 00:35:58 Attaching Fear to Events: Classical Conditioning & Memory; 00:41:45 How Fear Learning Occurs: Long Term Potentiation, NMDA; 00:46:10 Extinguishing (Reducing) Fears; 00:50:25 Cognitive (Narrative) Therapies for Fear; 00:57:56 Repetition of Narrative, Overwriting Bad Experiences with Good; 01:05:28 EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing; 01:14:00 Social Connection & Isolation Are Chemically Powerful; 01:18:23 Trans-Generational Trauma; 01:25:00 PTSD Treatments: Ketamine, MDMA, oxytocin; 01:39:25 How Do You Know If You Are Traumatized?; 01:46:16 Deliberate Brief Stress Can Erase Fears & Trauma; 01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas In 5 Minutes Per Day; 01:59:42 Nutrition, Sleep, & Other General Support Erasing Fear & Trauma; 02:02:30 Supplements for Anxiety, Fear: Saffron, Inositol, Kava; 02:10:00 Synthesis; 02:11:46 Zero-Cost Support, Sponsors, Patreon, Supplements, Instagram, Twitter"

Dr. Buss describes his work on how people select mates for short and long-term relationships, the dynamics of human courtship, and mate value assessment — meaning how people measure up as potential partners. Dr. Huberman and Dr. Buss also discuss the causes of infidelity and differences for infidelity in men and women. Dr. Buss explains how people evaluate and try to alter other people’s mate value as a means to secure and even poach mates. Dr. Huberman and Dr. Buss discuss monogamous and non-monogamous relationships in humans. And they discuss what Dr. Buss calls “the dark triad”— features common in stalkers and narcissists that relate to sexual and psychological violence in relationships.

b804bf0b-cd86-4cea-a96c-069f2ed0cc63,The Science of Gratitude & How to Build a Gratitude Practice,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses the science of gratitude, shown in peer-reviewed studies, to have tremendous positive effects on mental and physical health. He explains, however, that most commonly used gratitude practices are ineffective (such as gratitude lists). The key elements of highly effective gratitude practices are described, including the essential need for story (narrative), receiving or perceiving gratitude rather than giving it, and the role that theory of mind plays in this context. Dr. Huberman also discusses why we can’t simply make up feelings of gratitude and how reluctance undermines the process. He also explains the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie the reductions in fear and increases in motivation and lowering of inflammatory chemicals that effective narrative-based gratitude can trigger. Throughout the episode, he uses the science of gratitude to design a brief but highly effective protocol.",https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-gratitude-and-how-to-build-a-gratitude-practice/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=110s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=273s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=551s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=740s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=1070s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=1282s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=1510s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=1810s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=2095s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=2550s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=2750s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=3148s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=3375s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=3595s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=3780s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=3944s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=4055s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=4256s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=4560s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=4730s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=5065s,"00:00:00 Introduction: Gratitude Science & Surprises; 00:01:50 Controlling Heart Rate with Story; 00:04:33 Sponsors: ROKA, InsideTracker, Magic Spoon; 00:09:11 Major, Long-Lasting Benefits of Gratitude Practice; 00:12:20 Prosocial vs. Defensive Thinking, Behaviors, & Neural Circuits; 00:17:50 Why We All Need an Effective Gratitude Practice; 00:21:22 Neurochemistry & Neural Circuits of Gratitude; 00:25:10 Prefrontal Cortex Set Context; 00:30:10 Ineffective Gratitude Practices; Autonomic Variables; 00:34:55 Key Features of Effective Gratitude Practices: Receiving Thanks & Story; 00:42:30 Theory of Mind Is Key; 00:45:50 Building Effective Gratitude Practices: Adopting Narratives, Duration; 00:52:28 Narratives That Shift Brain-Body Circuits; 00:56:15 You Can’t Lie About Liking Something; Reluctance In Giving; 00:59:55 How Gratitude Changes Your Brain: Reduces Anxiety, Increases Motivation; 01:03:00 5 Minutes (Is More Than Enough), 3X Weekly, Timing Each Day; 01:05:44 Empathy & Anterior Cingulate Cortex; 01:07:35 Reducing Inflammation & Fear with Gratitude; 01:10:56 Serotonin, Kanna/Zembrin; 01:16:00 Neuroplasticity, Pharmacology, Brain Machine Interfaces; 01:18:50 The Best Gratitude Practices: & How To, My Protocol; 01:24:25 Subscribe & Feedback, Supporting Sponsors, Supplements (Thorne)"

He reviews the three types of time perception: of the past, of the present, and the future, and how dopamine and serotonin adjust both our perception of the speed of the passage of time and our memory of how long previous experiences lasted. Dr. Huberman also discusses circannual entrainment, which is the process by which our brain and body are matched to the seasons, and circadian (24 hours) entrainment, both of which subconsciously adjust our perceived measurement of time. He explains the mechanisms of that subconscious control. And he covers the ultradian (90 minutes) rhythms that govern our ability to focus, including how to track when these 90-minute rhythms begin and end for the sake of work and productivity. Dr. Huberman includes ten tools based on the science of time perception that you can apply to enhance productivity, creativity, and relationships in various contexts.",https://hubermanlab.com/time-perception-and-entrainment-by-dopamine-serotonin-and-hormones/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=312s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=565s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=800s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=966s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=1273s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=1380s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=1500s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=1902s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=2080s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=2238s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=2350s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=2558s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=2618s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=2678s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=3004s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=3063s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=3218s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=3390s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=3654s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=3780s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=4060s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=4318s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=4347s,"00:00:00 Introducing Time Perception, Note on Fasting & Supplements; 00:05:12 Sponsors: ROKA, Athletic Greens, InsideTracker; 00:09:25 Entrainment, Circannual Entrainment, Melatonin; 00:13:20 Seasonal Oscillations in Testosterone & Estrogen, Tool 1; 00:16:06 Circadian Timing, Tools 1, 2, 3 (for Circadian Entrainment); 00:21:13 Tool 4: Timing Physical Activity; Tool 5: Timing Eating Window; 00:23:00 When Circadian Entrainment is Disrupted, Time Perception Suffers; 00:25:00 Tool 6: Ultradian (90min) Cycles & Focus; 00:31:42 Our Sense of the Passage of Time: Present, Prospective, Retrospective; 00:34:40 Dopamine (& Nor/epinephrine) Lead to Time Overestimation; Frame Rate; 00:37:18 Serotonin & Time Underestimation; Decreased Frame Rate; 00:39:10 Dopamine vs. Serotonin Across the Day; Tool 7: When to Do Rigid vs. Creative Work; 00:42:38 Example of Tool 7; 00:43:38 How Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance; 00:44:38 Trauma, “Over-clocking” & Memories; Adjusting Rates of Experience; 00:50:04 Why Trauma Involves Dopamine & Epinephrine, Arousal; 00:51:03 Dopamine, Spontaneous Blinking & Time Perception; Tool 8; 00:53:38 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate in Discomfort; 00:56:30 Fun “Feels Fast” BUT Is Remembered as Slow; Boring Stuff “Feels Slow,” Recall As Fast; 01:00:54 Retrospective Time, Context Variation & Enhanced Bonding with Places & People; 01:03:00 Dopamine Release Resets the Start of Each Time Bin on Our Experience; 01:07:40 Habits & Time Perception; Tool 10 (Setting Functional Units of Each Day); 01:11:58 Synthesis & Book Suggestion (Your Brain Is a Time Machine by D.

Dr. Huberman discusses how our immune system works and science-supported tools we can use to enhance our immune system. He discusses the innate and adaptive immune systems and our various microbiomes—not just in our gut but also in our nose, eyes and mouth and how to keep them healthy. And he reviews how specific patterns of breathing and foods maintain a healthy mucosal barrier that is crucial for fighting infections. Dr. Huberman discusses how certain neurochemicals called catecholamines enhance our immune system function and how to use specific breathing protocols, types and timing of heat and cold exposure, and if appropriate, supplementation to activate catecholamines. He also discusses the role and use of serotonin for the sake of accessing the specific types of sleep for recovering from illness, and he discusses how to increase glymphatic “washout” of brain debris during sleep. Dr. Huberman also reviews fever, the vagus nerve and the use of atypical yet highly effective compounds for rhinitis (nasal inflammation).",https://hubermanlab.com/using-your-nervous-system-to-enhance-your-immune-system/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=180s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=461s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=680s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=1028s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=1266s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=1680s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=1833s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=2060s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=2096s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=2348s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=2520s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=2620s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=2805s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=3183s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=3304s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=4023s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=4253s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=4356s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=5350s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=5530s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=5820s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=6125s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=6369s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=6562s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=6820s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=7080s,"00:00:00 The Mind & Immune System, New Findings: Acupuncture & Fascia; 00:03:00 Sponsors: ROKA, Athletic Greens, InsideTracker; 00:07:41 Foundational Tools & Practices for of a Healthy Immune System; 00:11:20 Immune System Basics: Skin/Mucous, Innate & Adaptive Immune System; 00:17:08 Killer Cells, Complement Proteins (“Eat Me!” Signals), Cytokines (“Help Me!” Signals); 00:21:06 The Adaptive Immune System: Antibodies; 00:28:00 Tool 1: Nasal Microbiome and “Scrubbing” Bacteria & Viruses; Nasal Breathing; 00:30:33 Tools 2 & 3: (Not) Touching Your Eyes; Gut Microbiome & Fermented Foods; 00:34:20 Some Interleukins Are Anti-Inflammatory; 00:34:56 Sickness Behavior; 00:39:08 Some People Seek Care When Sick, Others Want to be Alone; 00:42:00 Sickness Behavior & Depression: Cytokines; 00:43:40 Reduced Appetites When Sick: Protein, Iron, Libido; 00:46:45 Vagus-Nerve Stimulation: Fever, Photophobia, Sleepiness; 00:53:03 Humoral (Blood-Borne) Factors, & Choroid Change Your Brain State; 00:55:04 Tools 4, 5: Reducing Sickness: Glymphatic Clearance, Pre-Sleep Serotonin, 5HTP; 01:07:03 Tool 6: Hot Showers, Saunas, Baths & Cortisol, Heath-Cold Contrast; 01:10:53 Feed a Fever & Starve a Cold (?), Adrenaline; 01:12:36 Tool 7: Activating Your Immune System w/Cyclic-Hyperventilation, Alkalinity; 01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine; 01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, You Can Worry Yourself Sick; 01:37:00 Tool 8: Healthy Mindsets, Hope, Dopamine; Tool 9: Tyrosine; Tool 10: Cold Exposure; 01:42:05 Once You’re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis; 01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells; 01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism for How It Reduces Inflammation; Fascia, Rolfing; 01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices; 01:58:00 Synthesis, Ways to Support Us (Zero-Cost), Sponsors, Supplements, Social Media"

a7d5d595-468c-44ea-8900-df9dc3b13d02,Nutrients For Brain Health & Performance,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman describes science-supported nutrients for brain and performance (cognition) and general nervous system health. He describes ten tools for this purpose, including specific amounts and sources for Omega-3 fatty acids, which make up the “structural fat” of neurons (nerve cells) and allow them to function across our lifespan. He also reviews data on creatine, phosphatidylserine, anthocyanins, choline, glutamine and how they each impact brain function in healthy people seeking to reinforce and improve their cognition and in those combatting cognitive decline. Dr. Huberman describes both food-based and supplement-based sources for these compounds and their effective dose ranges based on peer-reviewed literature. Then he reviews the three factors: gut-brain signaling, perceived taste, and learned associations that combine with the metabolic and blood-sugar-elevating effects of food to determine what foods we seek and prefer. Amazingly, it’s not just about what tastes good to us. Next, Dr. Huberman explores how we can leverage the neural circuits of learned food preference toward seeking and enjoying the right foods for brain health and performance. He also reviews new data on non-caloric sweeteners and why consuming them with glucose-elevating foods can be detrimental, in some cases rapidly leading to insulin dysregulation. This episode covers more than ten actionable tools for those seeking to improve and/or maintain brain function. It explains modern neuroscience underlying our sense of taste, our food-seeking preferences, and brain metabolism.",https://hubermanlab.com/nutrients-for-brain-health-and-performance/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=128s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=259s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=504s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=562s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=780s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=1235s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=1335s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=1706s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=1790s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=1942s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=2188s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=2479s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=2963s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=3325s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=3590s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=3974s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=4036s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=4331s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=4405s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=4695s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=4937s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=5442s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=5765s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=5908s,"00:00:00 Food & Brain Function Introduction; 00:02:08 Summary: Critical Aspects of Time Restricted Feeding/Fasting; 00:04:19 Sponsors: Roka, Athletic Greens, Headspace; 00:08:24 Neuroplasticity Super Protocol (Zero-Cost Tools) Online; 00:09:22 Eating to Enhance Brain Function & Foundational Aspects of Brain Health; 00:13:00 Eating Fats for Brain Health, EFAs Phospholipids (Tool 1: 1-3g EPA Omega-3/day); 00:20:35 Phosphatidylserine (Tool 2: 300mg/day); 00:22:15 Choline, Egg Yolks (Tool 3: 1-2g/day Threshold); 00:28:26 Hydration & Electrolytes (Tool 4); 00:29:50 Liquid Fish Oil/Capsules (2-3g EPA per day; 300mg Alpha GPC 2-4X/week); 00:32:22 Creatine for Cognition (Tool 5: 5g/day); 00:36:28 Anthocyanins, Dark Skin Berries (Tool 6-10mg/day (Extract), 1-2 cups Berries); 00:41:19 L-Glutamine (Tool: 1-10g/day) & Offsetting Apnea & Inflammation; 00:49:23 Neural Basis of Food Preference, Yum, Yuck, Meh; Taste, Guts, & Beliefs; 00:55:25 Taste is 100% In your Head; 00:59:50 Gut Neurons Controlling Food Preference: Neuropod Cells; (Tool 7: Fermented Foods); 01:06:14 Capsule Probiotics, Brain Fog; 01:07:16 Learning to Like Specific Tastes: Sweetness & Brain Metabolism; 01:12:11 Hard-Wiring & Soft-Wiring; 01:13:25 Artificial & Non-Caloric Sweeteners: Safe or Harmful Depends on (Glucose) Context; 01:18:15 Non-Caloric Sweetener & Insulin; (Tool 8: Don’t Have w/Glucose Elevating Foods); 01:22:17 Beliefs & Thoughts; The Insula; (Tool 9: Pairing-Based Reshaping Food Preferences); 01:30:42 Liking Neuro-Healthy Foods & Bettering Brain Metabolism (Tool 10); Food Wars; 01:36:05 Food Reward & Diabetes, Obesity; Important Review Article (See Caption); 01:38:28 Synthesis, Zero-Cost Support, Future Topic Suggestions, Sponsors, Supplements"
5613b996-f780-43ea-8d6f-0204d84c7340,Effects of Fasting & Time Restricted Eating on Fat Loss & Health,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses the science and practice of fasting, also called time-restricted feeding. He reviews the data on how limiting food intake to specific portions of every 24-hour cycle (or fasting longer) impacts weight loss, fat loss specifically, liver health, mental focus, muscle, longevity and more. Dr. Huberman explains how “fasted” is contextual and relates to blood glucose levels and their downstream effects, and how the depth of fasting can be adjusted with behaviors such as different types of exercise or with glucose disposal agents. He also discusses the optimal fasting protocol: and both the absolute (non-negotiable) and variable (contextual) features of a fasting/time-restricted-feeding protocol that will allow you to get the most benefits. He also discusses what does and does not break a fast, the effects of fasting on hormones like testosterone and cortisol, and fertility. Dr. Huberman also reviews how different feeding windows of 8 or 10 or 4 hours differentially impact the effects of fasting and why the classic 8 hour feeding window came to be but also might be ideal. He discusses mechanisms and offers tools to discern the optimal fasting duration and timing for you.",https://hubermanlab.com/effects-of-fasting-and-time-restricted-eating-on-fat-loss-and-health/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=362s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=582s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=680s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=830s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=1188s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=1533s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=1785s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=1886s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=2193s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=2385s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=2495s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=2738s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=3155s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=3340s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=3570s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=3788s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=4093s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=4400s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=4957s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=5260s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=5355s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=5520s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=5920s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=6110s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=6329s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=6435s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=6552s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=6795s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=7130s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=7302s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=7602s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=7700s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=7763s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=7872s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=8640s,"00:00:00 Introduction, Blood Glucose & Mortality, Mice Vs.

He discusses both behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for ADHD and brain-machine interface tools. Dr. Huberman also discusses behavioral training protocols that can improve focus in people with ADHD and those without ADHD and for people of different ages. He discusses the role of dopamine in coordinating ‘default-mode’ and ‘task-related’ neural networks, attentional “blinks” (lapses of attention) and how to overcome them, and the role of actual blinks in time perception and attention. Finally, Dr. Huberman reviews some of the prescription and over-the-counter compounds for increasing focus, such as Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil and Armodafinil, the racetams, Alpha-GPC and phosphatidylserine and the role of diet for managing ADHD (and the controversies of diet for ADHD). The role of cell phones/technology in ADHD and ADHD-like challenges with focus are also discussed.

He also addresses how protein is assimilated better early in the day than it is later in the day and why those using intermittent fasting might want to shift their feeding window to earlier in the day. Then he delves into the topic of disorders of eating: Anorexia Nervosa, where people starve themselves and Bulimia Nervosa, where people binge and purge their food. Dr. Huberman discusses some common myths about Anorexia, such as the role of media images increasing the rates of Anorexia and the myth of the “perfectionist” anorexic. He also reviews the symptoms and the brain and chemical systems disrupted in this condition. He explains how anorexics become hyperaware of the fat content of foods and develop reflexive habits of fat-hyperawareness. Then Dr. Huberman discusses the most effective treatments ranging from family-based models to those that target the habitual nature of low-fat/calorie food choices. He also discusses new, more experimental clinical trials on MDMA, Psilocybin and Ibogaine for Anorexia and both their promise and risks. Dr. Huberman reviews the latest work on binge eating disorder and brain stimulation, drug treatments and thyroid disruption in Bulimia and why the treatments for Bulimia are so similar to those for ADHD. Finally, he discusses “cheat days,” body dysmorphia and the growing list of novel forms of eating disorders from start to finish.

They discuss stress, what defines short-term versus long-term stress, and how stress can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on the context. Drs. Huberman and Sapolsky also discuss stress mitigation and how our sense of control over stress mitigation techniques, including exercise, determine health outcomes. Dr. Sapolsky explains some of the key effects of the hormone testosterone — how it can amplify pre-existing tendencies for aggression or sexual behavior, but that it does not produce those behaviors per se. He also explains how testosterone impacts our social hierarchies, sense of confidence, and willingness to embrace challenges of different kinds. He also explains how our behaviors and perceptions shape testosterone levels. And they discuss estrogen and the powerful role it plays in brain development, health and longevity.

Dr. Lembke is a psychiatrist expert in treating addictions of all kinds: drugs, alcohol, food, sex, video games, gambling, food, medication, etc. Dr. Lembke is also an expert in the opioid crisis and the author of Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence. Drs. Huberman and Lembke discuss the biology and psychology of why people become addicted to certain substances and behaviors and the key role that our “dopamine balance” plays in creating addiction. They also discuss the science and practice of how to conquer addictions, why people relapse and how to avoid relapsing. Dr. Lembke also shares her expertise on topics closely related to addiction, such as community, shame and lying. She explains why telling the truth—even about the most basic things in daily life, adjusts dopamine levels in our brain. This episode is important for anyone struggling with addictions of any kind, for their friends and families and health care professionals.

He discusses the science of behavioral tools like acupuncture and hypnosis and directed pressure, including the neural circuits they each activate to modulate our experience of pain or pleasure. Dr. Huberman also discusses whole body pain, pain “syndromes” and novel pain relief compounds such as Acetyl-L-Carnitine, SAMe and Agmatine. He discusses neuroplasticity of the pain system and the key role that visual perception plays in pain modulation. Finally, I address the link between dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin with arousal, pleasure and pain. As always, both basic science and various protocols are described. Note: The description of the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) was intentionally simplified and does not include mention of dorsal horn spinal relay neurons, etc. For an excellent full-text review of this anatomy and circuits for touch sensing, please read this article.",https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-control-your-sense-of-pain-and-pleasure/,https://www.instagram.com/p/CMVq0X8Bk1D/; https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/11/3/356/1885635; https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30532-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627320305328%3Fshowall%3Dtrue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=110s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=432s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=724s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=1093s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=1336s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=1691s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=2025s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=2427s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=2722s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=2890s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=3124s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=3488s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=3660s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=3880s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=4344s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=4647s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=5300s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=5400s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=5873s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=6242s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=6563s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=6700s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=6940s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=7180s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=7284s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=7600s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=7720s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmhsWAqP_0Y&t=7980s,"00:00:00 Skin, Pain, Pleasure; 00:01:50 Protocol 1: Maximizing Motivation (with Dopamine & Pleasure); 00:07:12 Sponsors: InsideTracker, Helix Sleep, Athletic Greens; 00:12:04 Pleasure & Pain, & Skin Sensors; 00:18:13 Sensing Touch with Your Brain: Magnification of Feet, Hands, Lips, Face, Genitals; 00:22:16 Two-Point Discrimination, Dermatomes; 00:28:11 Thoughts & Genes That Make Physical Pain Worse; 00:33:45 Expectations, Anxiety, & Pain Threshold; 00:40:27 Protocol 2: Cold Sensing Is Relative; Getting Into Cold Water; 00:45:22 Protocol 3: Heat Is Absolute; 00:48:10 Injury & Pain; 00:52:04 Protocol 4: Plasticity of Pain: Key Role of Vision; 00:58:08 Sensing Disparate Body Parts As Merged; 01:01:00 Pain “Syndromes”, Psychogenic Fever, “Psychosomatics”; 01:04:40 Fibromyalgia, Naltrexone, Protocol 5: Acetyl-L-Carnitine; 01:12:24 Protocol 6: Agmatine, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolate*; 01:17:27 Acupuncture: Mechanism, Non-Responders, Itch & Inflammation; 01:28:20 Laser Photobiomodulation, Protocol 7: Hypnosis (reveri.com); 01:30:00 Protocol 8: Pressure-Based Pain Relief, “Gate Theory of Pain (Relief)”; 01:37:53 Redheads & Pain Thresholds, Endogenous Opioids; 01:44:02 Protocol 8: Love & Pain, Dopamine; 01:49:23 Pleasure & Reproduction, Dopamine & Serotonin, Oxytocin; 01:51:40 Protocol 9: PEA, L-Phenylalanine (Precursor to Tyrosine); 01:55:40 Contextual Control of Pleasure by Autonomic Arousal, Dopamine Baselines; 01:59:40 Pleasure-Pain Balance; 02:01:24 Protocol 10: Controlling Pleasure, Dopamine & Motivation Over Time; 02:06:40 Protocol 11: Immediate, Non-Goal-Directed Pleasure, PAG; 02:08:40 Direction of Touch: Pleasure Versus Pain, Arousal & Touch “Sensitivity”; 02:13:00 Synthesis & How to Conceptualize Pain and Pleasure, Support"

The conscious awareness of this brain-body dialogue is called interoception. He describes how two factors- mechanical forces (e.g., pressure, pain, volume, etc.) and chemical factors (e.g., gut acidity, microbiome diversity, etc.) combine to influence our moods, control inflammation, immune system, recovery from injury and more. He explains how specific actions of our lungs, heart, spleen, and diaphragm control our brain via the vagus nerve and other neural pathways.

How things smell and taste and chemicals in the tears, breath, and the skin of others have a profound effect on how we feel, what we do and our hormones. He explains the three types of responses to smell, the five types of tastes, the possible existence of the sixth taste sense and how the act of sniffing can make us learn and focus better. He explains how smell and taste reflect brain health and can assess and even promote brain regeneration. Dr. Huberman discusses how eating specific categories of foods makes us crave more of those foods. Both basic science and protocols are described, including making sour things taste sweet and developing a heightened sense of smell and taste.",https://hubermanlab.com/how-smell-taste-and-pheromone-like-chemicals-control-you/,https://www.amazon.com/What-Color-Questions-Answers-Science/dp/1419734512; https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqa2ZwRzhVWGJ2YTBNTDRsX3M4M3E5XzM5MC1RZ3xBQ3Jtc0trWm9PUndYQW1LaXBCd29hV2JVanh4VnlPRGJLejNsYXlTVXZzNFVkSUJFZFdvNmhWbHllOXVyelVOWXBYMHkwV2pIQWt5Z1NMcTQ1RVRMN3RRZmM0dTQ2bGdHUzlwSjBWUHRObVVGOWNTSGN4Ny1Naw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWhat-Color-Questions-Answers-Science%2Fdp%2F1419734512; https://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6014/226.figures-only; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0556-z; https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2018/01000/Acute_Effects_of_Ammonia_Inhalants_on_Strength_and.31.aspx; https://academic.oup.com/molehr/article/19/6/349/1061673,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=362s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=550s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=740s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=834s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=1048s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=1276s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=1480s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=1600s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=1736s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=2040s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=2150s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=2305s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=2625s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=2910s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=3020s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=3213s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=3280s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=3455s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=3588s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=3780s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=3872s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=4125s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=4428s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=4505s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=4770s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=4940s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=5105s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=5235s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=5405s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=5548s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=5615s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=5940s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=5984s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=6183s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=6400s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=6559s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=6630s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=6780s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=7000s,"00:00:00 Introduction; 00:06:02 Sensing Chemicals: Smell, Taste & Chemicals That People Make To Control Each Other; 00:09:10 Vision Protocols Recap (Brief): Near-Far Viewing & 2 hours/day outside, & Correction; 00:12:20 Color Vision: Excellent Resource: What is Color?

827718a7-a84b-4ef6-bf59-815433adaf08,How to Lose Fat with Science-Based Tools,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman describes the science of fat loss, including how fat is mobilized and oxidized (burned) and how to increase fat burning by leveraging the nervous system. Most people don’t realize it, but our neurons connect to our fat and release epinephrine/adrenaline to facilitate fat oxidation. He explains how this can be accomplished with non-exercise movements such as fidgeting to burn thousands of calories of fat a day—a practice that is rarely discussed but very well supported by the scientific literature. He also discusses an optimal fat loss protocol using cold to create shiver, and how specific types and timing of exercise impact fat loss. Dr. Huberman discusses if exercising fasted indeed increases fat oxidation—it turns out the type and duration of exercise really matter. And he discusses the use of caffeine, GLP1 from Mate or guayusa and emerging new prescription compounds for fat loss. The episode includes a lot of tools, links to cost-free resources and an explanation of the science underlying each tool for fat loss.",https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-lose-fat-with-science-based-tools/,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303720709004559?via%3Dihub; https://thecoldplunge.com/pages/protocols,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=360s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=524s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=660s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=818s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=1160s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=1388s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=1500s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=1648s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=1945s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=2085s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=2484s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=2695s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=2850s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=3025s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=3146s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=3375s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=3483s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=3497s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=3600s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=3715s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=3840s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=3900s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=4160s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=4410s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=4590s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=4695s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=4964s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=5165s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=5330s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=5670s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=5722s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=6030s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=6088s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=6180s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=6275s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=6480s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=6680s,"00:00:00 Introduction; 00:06:00 Fat Loss: The Key Role of Neurons; 00:08:44 The First Law of Fat Loss; 00:11:00 Neurons Connect To Fat!

He also describes what to do immediately after a training session (note: this is different than the optimal protocol for cognitive skill training) and as you progress to more advanced levels of performance. He also covers the science of skill-based visualization, which does have benefits, but only if done correctly and at the correct times. Dr. Huberman discusses auto-replay of skill learning in the brain during sleep and the value of adding in post-training ‘deliberately idle’ sessions. He covers how to immediately improve limb-range-of-motion by leveraging cerebellum function, error generation, optimal repetition numbers for learning and more.

d9408be7-15fe-49c9-8926-e14b476e6d67,Supercharge Exercise Performance & Recovery with Cooling,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman explains the science of heating and cooling the body, a process called thermoregulation—and how to apply that knowledge to significantly improve physical performance. He describes the three areas of our body that can remove heat (or bring heat into the body) faster than anywhere else, why that is so, and how proper cooling of these areas with specific protocols can allow people to perform 200-600% more volume and repetitions of resistance exercises at the same weight loads, or to run, cycle or swim significantly further. He also describes how to use directed cooling of so-called glabrous skin: the bottoms of feet, palms and face, to significantly enhance recovery times from exercise. Also, why the common practices of trying to heat up or cool the body via the torso or whole-body submersion in the cold can be inefficient and/or dangerous—and the better alternatives. Finally, Dr. Huberman discusses the temperature effects of caffeine, alcohol and anti-inflammatory compounds.

2251a033-f172-482f-b5ec-8facba025b71,How to Control Your Metabolism by Thyroid & Growth Hormone," In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses metabolism and how our thyroid hormone and growth hormone control our metabolism. He also clarifies that metabolism isn’t just about burning energy; it’s about converting energy from different sources into fuels to build and repair our tissues such as muscle, brain, and tendons and mobilize energy from body fat storage. He discusses the role of iodine, selenium, and salt for thyroid health and how specific exercise protocols, amino acids and temperature can dramatically shift levels of growth hormone release in waking and in sleep. He also describes the current landscape of prescription compounds, peptides, and other factors for changing thyroid and growth hormone levels and some of their risks.

He explains the brain areas that control our desire to eat and our desire to stop eating. He discusses a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV rays from sunlight that reduce our appetite. He also explains that when we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to leverage that fact). He describes how we are basically always eating until we reach a threshold level of fatty acids and amino acids in our gut and the factors that can alter that signaling and make us eat far more than we need. Dr. Huberman also explains how insulin, glucose and glucagon work, why cholesterol is so key for ovary, adrenal, liver and testes function and how the ketogenic diet impacts glucose and thyroid levels. As always, he describes many tools: specific supplements, prescription compounds, specific types (and timing) of exercise to regulate hormones, specific timing and types of eating, ways to reduce sugar cravings by triggering the release of the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), and more.",https://hubermanlab.com/how-our-hormones-control-our-hunger-eating-and-satiety/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxyxcTZccsE&t=0s; https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(19)30248-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413119302487%3Fshowall%3Dtrue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=419s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=512s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=665s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=788s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=988s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=1017s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=1203s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=1350s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=1480s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=1640s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=1775s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=1982s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=2095s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=2345s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=2622s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=2972s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=3156s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=3372s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=3760s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=3890s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=3940s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=4075s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=4228s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=4500s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=4605s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=4925s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=5074s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=5200s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=5290s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=5468s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=5719s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU&t=5840s,"00:00:00 Introduction; 00:06:59 Hunger: Neural & Hormonal Control; 00:08:32 Chewing & Hunger; 00:11:05 Siamese Rats Reveal the Importance of Hormones In Hunger; 00:13:08 Neurons That Powerfully Control Hunger by Releasing Specific Hormones; 00:16:28 Anorexia & Extreme Overeating; 00:16:57 Why Sunlight Suppresses Hunger: a-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (a -MSH); 00:20:03 Blue-blockers, Injecting a-MSH: Instant Tan & Priapism; 00:22:30 Ghrelin: A Hormone That Determines When You Get Hungry, & That You Can Control; 00:24:40 Meal Timing Determines Hunger, Not the Other Way Around; 00:27:20 Satchin Panda, Circadian Eating & Intermittent(ish) Fasting; 00:29:35 How To Rationally Adjust Meal Schedules: The 45min Per Day Rule; 00:33:02 CCK (Cholecystokinin): A Hormone In Your Gut That Says “No Mas!”; 00:34:55 Eating For Amino Acids, Fatty Acids & Sugar; 00:39:05 L-Glutamine: Stimulates the Immune System & Reduces Sugar Cravings; 00:43:42 Things To Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing; 00:49:32 “A Calorie Is NOT A Calorie” After All; 00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia; 00:56:12 The Order Your Eat Foods Matters: Managing Your Blood Glucose & Glucagon; 01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4; 01:04:50 Why Sugar Stimulates Your Appetite; 01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable With Specific Exercises, The Power Of Insulin Sensitivity; 01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism; 01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver, Adrenals; 01:15:00 Prescription Compounds That Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin; 01:16:45 Berberine: A Potent Glucose Buffer That Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels, Canker Sores; 01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, & Zinc; 01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity; 01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects On Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones; 01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine; 01:31:08 The Power of GLP-1 & Yerba Mate For Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes; 01:35:19 Summary & Notes About Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone; 01:37:20 Zero Cost & Sponsor-Based Ways To Support The Huberman Lab Podcast"
15be58be-8cc1-43fb-8eb4-c762730cfdca,The Science of How to Optimize Testosterone & Estrogen," In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses the hormones testosterone and estrogen and how they impact the brain, body, and behavior at ages after puberty. He also discusses how various behaviors such as exercise (resistance and endurance training) and sex or observing sex impact these hormones and their levels. He asks: “what specifically is it about such activities that impact testosterone and estrogen?”; the resounding theme is that when our nervous system is activated in particular ways, it drives our endocrine system and vascular system to activate or repress certain hormone networks in predictable ways. He also discusses peer-reviewed studies and protocols addressing (at a mechanistic level) how light, cold and heat and respiration (breathing) can positively or negatively impact testosterone and estrogen. And we discuss specific supplements and compounds that peer-reviewed studies illustrate can adjust testosterone and estrogen levels: by changing their binding to other proteins, by raising them directly, or by changing other hormones released from the brain and pituitary. Dr. Huberman discusses optimization in the normal reference ranges for these hormones and discusses pheromones, apnea, menstrual cycles, menopause and andropause.
