d42b1af1-0792-4bb5-be7a-66a52060fe24,Journal Club with Dr. Peter Attia | Metformin for Longevity & The Power of Belief Effects,"In this journal club episode, my guest is Stanford and Johns Hopkins-trained physician, Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., who is also the host of The Drive podcast and the author of the bestselling book “Outlive: The Science & Art of Longevity.” We each present a scientific paper and discuss the findings’ strengths, weaknesses and actionable takeaways. First, we discuss an article that addresses whether taking the drug metformin can enhance longevity. Then, we discuss an article on belief effects (similar to placebo effects), showing how the effects of a drug on the brain and cognition depend on one’s belief about the dose of the drug taken, not the actual dose. Our conversation also highlights how to read, interpret and critique scientific studies. This episode ought to be of interest to those curious about health and longevity, medicine and psychology and for anyone seeking to better understand how to read and digest scientific findings.",https://hubermanlab.com/journal-club-with-dr-peter-attia-metformin-for-longevity-and-the-power-of-belief-effects/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=207s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=371s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=756s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=1187s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=1530s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=2179s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=2235s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=2667s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=3088s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=3677s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=3743s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=4140s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=4562s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=5028s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=5542s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=5890s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=6322s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=6667s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=7207s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=7514s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=7857s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=8346s,"00:00:00 Dr. Peter Attia, Journal Club; 00:03:27 Sponsors: Helix Sleep & Levels; 00:06:11 Dreams; 00:12:36 Article #1, Metformin, Mitochondria, Blood Glucose; 00:19:47 Type 2 Diabetes & Causes, Insulin Resistance; 00:25:30 Type 2 Diabetes Medications, Metformin, Geroprotection, Bannister Study; 00:36:19 Sponsor: AG1; 00:37:15 TAME Trial; Demographics, Twin Cohort; 00:44:27 Metformin & Mortality Rate; 00:51:28 Kaplan-Meier Mortality Curve, Error Bars & Significance, Statistical Power; 01:01:17 Sponsor: InsideTracker; 01:02:23 Hazard Ratios, Censoring; 01:09:00 Metformin Advantage?, Variables, Interventions Testing Program; 01:16:02 Berberine, Acarbose, SGLT2 Inhibitors; 01:23:48 Blood Glucose & Energy Balance; Caloric Restriction, Aging Biomarkers; 01:32:22 Tool: Reading Journal Articles, 4 Questions, Supplemental Information; 01:38:10 Article #2, Belief Effects vs. Placebo Effect; 01:45:22 Nicotine Effects; 01:51:07 Nicotine Doses & Belief Effects, fMRI Scan; 02:00:07 Biological Effects, Dose-Dependent Response & Belief Effects; 02:05:14 Biology & Beliefs, Significance, Dopamine Response, Non-Smokers; 02:10:57 Dose-Dependence & Beliefs, Side Effects, Nocebo Effect; 02:19:06 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media",z8c6EyMNd0A,318,"['Journal Club', 'Longevity', 'The Power', 'Belief Effects', 'Journal Club']","['this journal club episode', 'my guest', 'Stanford and Johns Hopkins-trained physician', 'M.D.', 'who', 'the host', 'The Drive podcast', 'the author', 'the bestselling book', 'The Science', 'Art', 'Longevity', 'We', 'each', 'a scientific paper', 'the findings’ strengths', 'weaknesses', 'actionable takeaways', 'we', 'an article', 'that', 'the drug metformin', 'longevity', 'we', 'an article', 'belief effects', 'placebo effects', 'the effects', 'a drug', 'the brain', 'cognition', 'one’s belief', 'the dose', 'the drug', 'not the actual dose', 'Our conversation', 'scientific studies', 'This episode', 'interest', 'those', 'health', 'longevity', 'medicine', 'psychology', 'anyone', 'scientific findings', 'journal club episode', 'guest is Stanford', 'Johns Hopkins-trained physician', 'Drive podcast', 'bestselling book “ Outlive', 'Longevity. ”', 'findings ’ strengths', 'drug metformin', 'enhance longevity', 'belief effects', 'placebo effects', '’ s belief']","190,546"

Dr. Conti defines mental health in actionable terms and describes the foundational elements of the self, including the structure and function of the unconscious and conscious mind, which give rise to all our thoughts, behaviors and emotions. He also explains how to explore and address the root causes of anxiety, low confidence, negative internal narratives, over-thinking and how our unconscious defense mechanisms operate. This episode provides a foundational roadmap to assess your sense of self and mental health. It offers tools to reshape negative emotions, thought patterns and behaviors — either through self-exploration or with a licensed professional. The subsequent three episodes in this special series explore additional tools to further understand and improve your mental health.",https://hubermanlab.com/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-understand-and-assess-your-mental-health/,https://hubermanlab.com/dr-paul-conti-therapy-treating-trauma-and-other-life-challenges;

We discuss what it takes to be a true innovator, including the personality traits required, the role of environment and the support systems needed to bring revolutionary ideas to fruition. We discuss risk-taking as a necessary but potentially hazardous trait, as well as the role of intrinsic motivation and one’s ability to navigate uncertainty. We also discuss artificial intelligence (AI) and Marc’s stance that soon everyone will use AI as their personalized coach and guide for making decisions about their health, relationships, finances and more — all of which he believes will greatly enhance our quality of life. We also delve into nuclear power, gene editing, public trust, universities, politics, and AI regulation.

We discuss individual differences between people — focusing on differences in how people sense the world around them and the roles that chance, heredity, and life experiences (even in utero) play in determining our physical and cognitive traits. We discuss the bidirectional connection between the mind and body and how our thoughts and mental practices (e.g., meditation and breathwork) impact our health.

c0e1b8c6-c278-4100-a94f-f7dd9b01d01b,"Ketamine: Benefits and Risks for Depression, PTSD & Neuroplasticity","In this episode, I explain how ketamine causes rewiring of brain circuits and dissociative states to relieve symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). I explain how ketamine impacts both the brain’s glutamate and its endogenous opioid pathways, which together regulate mood and well-being. I discuss how ketamine therapy is used clinically to treat major depression, bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), suicidality and other psychiatric challenges. I also describe how ketamine causes the subjective effects of dissociation and euphoria and, at higher doses, is an anesthetic. I compare the different routes of ketamine administration, dosages and forms of ketamine, and if micro-dosing ketamine is effective. I also highlight the potential risks of recreational ketamine use (and the colloquial term ‘K-holes’).

8b9c4fe0-268b-4d64-846b-ac7a1952bc32,Dr. Maya Shankar: How to Shape Your Identity & Goals,"In this episode, my guest is Maya Shankar, Ph.D., a cognitive scientist, former senior advisor to the White House and Chair of the White House Social and Behavioral Sciences Team. She is the creator and host of the podcast, A Slight Change of Plans. We discuss how our identities develop and change, how our beliefs and internal narratives shape our perception of self, and how to use structured introspection about our values to determine our goals. We discuss how to cope and grow through uncertain situations, especially those that force us to reexamine our roles and identity.

d7601ecc-7413-46c0-b3c4-0e6f884041c6,How to Enhance Performance & Learning by Applying a Growth Mindset,"In this episode, I discuss how to build and apply a growth mindset — the practice of self-rewarding and focusing on learning and skill development through effort — to improve learning and performance. I also discuss how our internal narratives drive our ability to make progress. I contrast the growth mindset vs. the fixed mindset and describe how the type of feedback or praise we receive shapes our mindsets, and the huge advantage of rewarding and celebrating “verbs” (actions) rather than adjectives (performance labels). I also discuss data showing how stress can enhance performance and explain why the growth mindset works synergistically with the “stress-is-enhancing mindset,” and how to combine them. Whether you are a student, coach, therapist, parent, teacher or simply someone seeking to improve at something, this episode provides numerous science-supported tools for how to adopt a performance enhancing mindset.",https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-enhance-performance-and-learning-by-applying-a-growth-mindset/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=175s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=317s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=778s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=1210s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=1605s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=1733s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=1950s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=2076s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=2141s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=2408s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=3028s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=3263s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=3330s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=3953s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=4401s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=4836s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=5145s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=5297s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=5484s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=5578s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=5675s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQDOU3hPci0&t=5960s,"00:00:00 Growth Mindset; 00:02:55 Sponsors: Eight Sleep & ROKA; 00:05:17 Mindset & Narrative; 00:12:58 Intelligence Feedback vs. Effort Feedback, Identity Labels; 00:20:10 Intelligence vs. Effort Praise: Performance, Persistence & Self-Representation; 00:26:45 Fixed Intelligence vs. Growth Mindset; 00:28:53 Tool: Intelligence (Performance) vs. Effort Narrative, Labels; 00:32:30 Tool: Failure & Identity; Effort & Verbs; 00:34:36 Sponsor: AG1; 00:35:41 Tool: Timing, Intelligence vs. Effort Praise & Performance; 00:40:08 Fixed Mindset vs. Growth Mindset: Failure & Performance; 00:50:28 Tool: Shift from Fixed Mindset; 00:54:23 Sponsor: InsideTracker; 00:55:30 Stress-is-Enhancing Mindset; 01:05:53 How Stress Can Enhance Performance; 01:13:21 Growth Mindset + Stress-is-Enhancing Mindset & Performance; 01:20:36 Reframing Stress; 01:25:45 Tool 1: Student & Teacher Mindset; 01:28:17 Tool 2: Effort Praise/Feedback: Verbs not Labels; 01:31:24 Tool 3: Errors & Seeking Help; 01:32:58 Tool 4: Self-Teaching & Growth Mindset; 01:34:35 Tool 5: Reframe “Mind is Like a Muscle” Analogy; 01:39:20 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter",aQDOU3hPci0,958,"['Performance', 'Learning', 'a Growth Mindset', 'Enhance Performance']","['this episode', 'I', 'a growth mindset', 'the practice', 'learning', 'skill development', 'effort', 'learning', 'performance', 'I', 'our internal narratives', 'our ability', 'progress', 'I', 'the growth mindset', 'the fixed mindset', 'how the type', 'feedback', 'praise', 'we', 'shapes', 'our mindsets', 'the huge advantage', '“verbs', 'actions', 'adjectives', 'performance labels', 'I', 'data', 'stress', 'performance', 'the growth mindset', 'the “stress-is-enhancing mindset', 'them', 'you', 'a student', 'coach', 'therapist', 'parent', 'teacher', 'simply someone', 'something', 'this episode', 'numerous science-supported tools', 'a performance', 'mindset', 'growth mindset', 'skill development', 'effort —', 'improve learning', 'make progress', 'growth mindset receive shapes', 'performance labels', 'discuss data', 'enhance performance', 'growth mindset performance enhancing mindset']","844,463"

We discuss the brain’s several reward systems involving dopamine and serotonin and how these motivate us to seek out specific behaviors and substances. We discuss how these reward systems are modified based on context and our memories, and how they can be hijacked toward maladaptive drug seeking in addiction. We also explore how reward systems influence social connections, oxytocin and empathy and how that applies to our understanding of autism spectrum disorders. This episode should be of interest to those interested in neuroplasticity, social bonding, addiction, autism, learning and motivation.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-robert-malenka-how-your-brains-reward-circuits-drive-your-choices/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=157s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=321s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=691s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=1054s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=1538s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=1850s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=2404s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=3051s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=3470s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=3818s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=3891s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=4360s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=4769s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=5430s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=5908s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=6193s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=6737s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=7339s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=7807s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=8243s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=8893s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=9438s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=9616s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI112zW8GDw&t=10077s,"00:00:00 Dr. Robert Malenka; 00:02:37 Sponsors: ROKA & Levels; 00:05:21 Dopamine & Reward Circuitry; 00:11:31 Reward, Arousal, Memory & Dopamine; 00:17:34 Context, Cues & Dopamine Modification; 00:25:38 Memory & Reward Scaling; 00:30:50 Dopamine, “Addictive Liability” & Route of Administration 00:39:07 Sponsor: AG1; 00:40:04 Drugs of Abuse & Brain Changes; Addiction & Individual Variability; 00:50:51 Reinforcement vs. Reward, Wanting vs. Liking; 00:57:50 Opioids, Psychostimulants & Dopamine; 01:03:38 Sponsor: LMNT; 01:04:51 Self-Doubt, Confidence & Career; 01:12:40 Autism Spectrum Disorder; 01:19:29 Pro-Social Interaction & Reward; Oxytocin, Serotonin & Dopamine; 01:30:30 Nucleus Accumbens & Behavior Probability; 01:38:28 Reward for Pro-Social Behavior; 01:43:13 Social Media & “Addictive Liability”; Gambling; 01:52:17 Pain, Social Behavior & Empathy; 02:02:19 Empathy Circuitry, Dopamine & Serotonin; 02:10:07 Autism Spectrum Disorder & Social Interactions, Empathy; 02:17:23 MDMA, Serotonin & Dopamine; Addiction & Pro-Social Effects; 02:28:13 Autism Spectrum Disorder, Social Behavior, MDMA & Pharmacology; 02:37:18 Serotonin, MDMA & Psychedelics; 02:40:16 Psychedelics: Research & Therapeutic Potential; 02:47:57 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter",RI112zW8GDw,629,"['Your Brain’s Reward Circuits', 'Your Choices']","['this episode', 'my guest', 'MD', 'PhD', 'a professor', 'psychiatry', 'behavioral sciences', 'Stanford School', 'Medicine', 'who', 'numerous seminal discoveries', 'how the brain changes', 'neuroplasticity', 'response', 'learning', 'response', 'rewarding and reinforcing experiences', 'We', 'the brain’s several reward systems', 'dopamine', 'serotonin', 'these', 'us', 'specific behaviors', 'substances', 'We', 'these reward systems', 'context', 'our memories', 'they', 'maladaptive drug', 'addiction', 'We', 'reward systems', 'oxytocin', 'empathy', 'that', 'our understanding', 'autism', 'spectrum disorders', 'This episode', 'interest', 'those', 'neuroplasticity', 'social bonding', 'addiction', 'autism', 'learning', 'motivation', 'Stanford School', 'brain changes', 'reinforcing experiences', 'brain ’', 'systems involving dopamine', 'systems influence', 'autism spectrum disorders']","666,047"

I discuss the neuronal mechanisms for how MDMA elevates mood, empathy, motivation, social engagement, and reduces “threat detection” and how these effects can synergistically support talk therapy. I also explain the ongoing debate about the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA, myths about the origins and treatments for post-MDMA “crash,” the evolving legal landscape around MDMA use for clinical purposes, and I caution recreational users about the extremely dangerous additives (e.g., fentanyl) now commonly found in black market MDMA.

91c33215-10bf-47ea-94cb-bd67d32c9f80,Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: The Science of Psychedelics for Mental Health,"In this episode, my guest is Robin Carhart-Harris, PhD, distinguished professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco. He is one of leading researchers in the study of how psychedelics such as psilocybin, LSD and DMT can change the human brain and in doing so, be used to successfully treat various mental health challenges such as major depression, anorexia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and addiction. He explains how psilocybin induces sustained changes in adaptive brain wiring and cognition. We discuss the key components of safe and effective psychedelic journeys, the role of hallucinations, the use of eye-masks to encourage people to “go internal,” and music, as well as what effective therapist support consists of before, during and after the session (also known as integration). We discuss micodosing vs. macrodosing and how researchers control for placebo effects in psychedelic research. We also discuss the current legal landscape around psychedelic therapies. Psychedelic therapies are fast emerging as powerful and soon-to-be mainstream treatments for medical health disorders, but they are not without their risks.

I discuss the emerging clinical trial evidence for the use of psilocybin in the treatment of depression, addictions and other psychiatric challenges. I explain the typical duration and phases of a psilocybin journey, the different categories of dosages often used and I explain the importance of set, setting and support when using psychedelics.

Dr. Sobel explains his lab’s research on the biological mechanisms of smell (“olfaction”) and how sensing odorants and chemicals in our environment impacts human behavior, cognition, social connections, and hormones. He explains how smell is a crucial component of “social sensing” and how we use olfaction when meeting new people to determine things about their physiology and psychology, and he explains how this impacts friendships and romantic partners. He explains how smell influences emotions, hormone levels, memories and the relationship between breathing and autonomic homeostasis. He describes how smell-based screening tests can aid disease diagnosis and explains his lab’s work on digitization of smell — which may soon allow online communication to include “sending of odors” via the internet.

I discuss neuroplasticity-based skill development and the roles of focus, sleep, movement restriction, and agitation. I then present five key principles of mental visualization to enhance learning speed, accuracy, and consistency.

Dr. MacDougall trained at the University of California, San Diego and Stanford University School of Medicine and is a world expert in brain stimulation, repair and augmentation. He explains Neuralink’s mission and projects to develop and use neural implant technologies and robotics to 1) restore normal movement to paralyzed patients and those with neurodegeneration-based movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s, Huntington’s Disease) and to repair malfunctions of deep brain circuitry (e.g., those involved in addiction). He also discusses Neuralink’s efforts to create novel brain-machine interfaces (BMI) that enhance human learning, cognition and communication as a means to accelerate human progress. Dr. MacDougall also explains other uses of bio-integrated machines in daily life; for instance, he implanted himself with a radio chip into his hand that allows him to open specific doors, collect and store data and communicate with machines and other objects in unique ways. Listeners will learn about brain health and function through the lens of neurosurgery, neurotechnology, clinical medicine and Neuralink’s bold and unique mission.

f0027fb4-ee29-4bc2-8572-2a47a50cbc09,"The Science of Healthy Hair, Hair Loss and How to Regrow Hair","In this episode, I explain the biology of hair, hair growth, why hair growth slows and what causes hair to stop growing and/or “fall out.” I discuss the essential role of hair stem cells and other supporting biological factors for healthy hair growth. Then I describe various approaches (mechanical and chemical) to slow hair loss by increasing blood flow to hair stem cells, including minoxidil, tadalafil, PRP, microneedling, Botox and ketoconazole treatments. I also discuss how age-related hormone changes cause hair loss and explain the effectiveness of treatments such as caffeine, saw palmetto, growth hormone, finasteride and dutasteride. For all hair growth options, I describe potential side effects, how soon to expect results and the amount of hair regrowth to expect and I highlight effective combination treatments for hair regrowth even in hair “dead” (bald) zones. For many listeners, thinning, brittle hair, or pattern baldness are a source of anxiety and stress. This episode explains the mechanisms underlying hair regrowth tools and the science behind them so that you can evaluate potential treatments and associated side-effect profiles and select the best one(s) for you.

We discuss her work showing how stress impacts mood, eating behavior, mental health, physical health, and aging. She explains stress intervention tools using “top-down” techniques (e.g., radical acceptance, mindfulness, reframing), body-based methods (e.g., breathwork) including the Wim Hof Method, exercise, meditation, body scans, and environmental shifts proven to help people cease unhealthy rumination patterns. We discuss how stress can positively impact psychology and sense of purpose, how stress affects cellular aging, how our narratives of stressful events impact our mood and biology, and how to effectively reframe stress. She explains science-based techniques to break stress-induced cycles of craving and overeating and thereby improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic health.

I also explain how to leverage dopamine dynamics to overcome procrastination. I cover behavioral, cognitive, nutrition-based and supplementation-based tools to optimize baseline and peak dopamine levels to ensure a persistently motivated state. I also discuss how to boost motivation when you are in a rut, why you might not want to stack behaviors/substances that spike dopamine and how to build and maintain a “growth mindset” for pursuing goals of any kind. Dopamine is an incredibly powerful neuromodulator involved in basic functions (e.g., hunger, romantic attraction, etc.) and feats of cognitive and physical performance; by understanding the dynamics of dopamine, listeners ought to be better positioned to overcome procrastination, maintain motivation, and improve confidence.",https://hubermanlab.com/leverage-dopamine-to-overcome-procrastination-and-optimize-effort/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=152s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=387s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=893s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=1033s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=1228s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=1706s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=1780s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=2260s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=2695s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=3043s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=3205s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=3728s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=3806s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=4178s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=4738s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=5011s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=5890s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=6109s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=6736s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k&t=7021s,"00:00:00 Dopamine; 00:02:32 Sponsors: Helix Sleep, WHOOP, ROKA, Momentous; 00:06:27 Dopamine Brain Circuits; 00:14:53 Goals & Addiction; 00:17:13 Dopamine Dynamics, “Wave Pool” analogy; 00:20:28 Craving, Motivation, Pursuit & Reward Prediction Error; 00:28:26 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens); 00:29:40 Feedback Cues & Reward Contingent Learning, “Scoreboard”; 00:37:40 Addiction; Pleasure & Pain Imbalance; 00:44:55 Dopamine Release & Addictive Substances/Behaviors; 00:50:43 Addiction Recovery, Binding Behaviors; 00:53:25 Tools: Maintain Baseline Dopamine Levels; 01:02:08 Sponsor: InsideTracker; 01:03:26 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Dopamine; 01:09:38 Prescriptions & Supplementation: L-Tyrosine, Mucuna Pruriens; 01:18:58 Dopamine Trough Recovery, Postpartum Depression; 01:23:31 Dopamine Dynamics, “Dopamine Stacking”; Intrinsic Motivation; 01:38:10 Making Effort the Reward, Growth Mindset; 01:41:49 Tool: Overcome Procrastination; 01:52:16 Tool: Meditation & Procrastination; 01:57:01 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media",K-TW2Chpz4k,1017,"['Procrastination', 'Optimize', 'Leverage Dopamine', 'Overcome Procrastination']","['this episode', 'I', 'how dopamine dynamics', 'changes', 'interactions', 'our baseline and peak levels', 'dopamine', 'our cravings', 'sense', 'motivation', 'I', 'dopamine dynamics', 'procrastination', 'I', 'behavioral, cognitive, nutrition-based and supplementation-based tools', 'baseline and peak dopamine levels', 'a persistently motivated state', 'I', 'motivation', 'you', 'a rut', 'you', 'behaviors/substances', 'a “growth mindset', 'goals', 'any kind', 'Dopamine', 'an incredibly powerful neuromodulator', 'basic functions', 'cognitive and physical performance', 'the dynamics', 'dopamine', 'listeners', 'procrastination', 'motivation', 'confidence', 'dynamics — meaning changes', 'peak levels', 'dopamine drive', 'overcome procrastination', 'optimize baseline', 'dopamine levels', 'motivated state', 'boost motivation', 'stack behaviors/substances', 'spike dopamine', 'growth mindset ”', 'pursuing goals', 'overcome procrastination maintain motivation', 'improve confidence']","946,729"

He also describes how the timing of eating, light exposure and exercise that ~50% of all people engage in, negatively impacts their health and explains how specific simple adjustments to these can positively shift their subjective feelings of health and biomarkers of cardiovascular function, glucose regulation and metabolism. We discuss how our circadian behaviors, which include our patterns of eating, sleeping and socializing, have an enormous impact on our biology, mood and health and how by simply confining our calorie consumption to a semi-regular daily window, can positively impact our physical health, mental health and longevity.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-satchin-panda-intermittent-fasting-to-improve-health-cognition-and-longevity/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=182s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=444s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=878s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=1294s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=1528s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=1969s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=2044s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=2840s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=3160s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=3544s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=3780s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=4507s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=4580s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=5197s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=5408s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=5765s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=6343s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=6659s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=7518s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=7755s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=8530s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=8720s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=8892s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=9117s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=9554s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=9696s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R3-3HR6-u4&t=9977s,"00:00:00 Dr. Satchin Panda; 00:03:02 Sponsors: HVMN, Eight Sleep, Thesis, Momentous; 00:07:24 Time-Restricted Eating (TRE), Calorie Restriction (CR) & Health; 00:14:38 Mealtimes & Circadian Clock; 00:21:34 Circadian Rhythm, Meal Anticipation, Digestion; 00:25:28 Breaking a Fast, Burning Fat; 00:32:49 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens); 00:34:04 CR, Time Restricted Eating, Circadian Rhythm & Longevity; 00:47:20 Gender, Hormones & CR; Relative Energy Deficient in Sports (REDS); 00:52:40 Physical Activity, Nutrition & Feeding Window; 00:59:04 Nutrition Timing, Quality & Quantity; Low- Carbohydrate Diet; 01:03:00 Caffeine, Nighttime Socialization, Fire, Breakfast; 01:15:07 Sponsor: InsideTracker; 01:16:20 Circadian Rhythm, “Night Owls” & Genetics; 01:26:37 Morning vs. Nighttime Discussions, “Me Time”; 01:30:08 Light Sensitivity & “Night Owls”; Puberty, Melatonin; 01:36:05 Shift Workers, Health & Disease; 01:45:43 Artificial Lights, Young Adults & Sleep, Metabolic Dysfunction; 01:50:59 Firefighters, Sleep & TRE; Cardiovascular Health, Blood Glucose; 02:05:18 Shift Workers & Sleep; Alcohol & Caffeine; 02:09:15 12- Hour Feeding Window for Adults & Children, Sleep; 02:22:10 Meal Timing; 02:25:20 “Complete Fast”, Longer Fasts, Physical Health & Mental Health; 02:28:12 “Fat Fasting”, Blood Glucose & Insulin; 02:31:57 Fasting, Metformin, Rapamycin & Longevity; Human Applicability?; 02:39:14 Circadian Rhythm & Metabolism; 02:41:36 Ontime Health App, Circadian Clock App; 02:46:17 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter",7R3-3HR6-u4,875,"['Health', 'Cognition', 'Longevity', 'Improve Health']","['this episode', 'my guest', 'PhD', 'professor', 'the director', 'the Regulatory Biology Laboratories', 'the Salk Institute', 'Biological Studies', 'We', 'his lab’s discovery', '“time-restricted eating', '(TRE', 'intermittent fasting', 'beneficial effects', 'metabolic health', 'longevity', 'TRE', 'also longer fasts', 'obesity', 'mood and cognitive performance', 'He', 'the timing', 'eating', 'light exposure', '%', 'all people', 'their health', 'specific simple adjustments', 'these', 'their subjective feelings', 'health', 'biomarkers', 'cardiovascular function', 'glucose regulation', 'metabolism', 'We', 'our circadian behaviors', 'which', 'our patterns', 'eating', 'socializing', 'an enormous impact', 'our biology', 'mood', 'health', 'our calorie consumption', 'a semi-regular daily window', 'our physical health', 'mental health', 'longevity', 'Regulatory Biology', 'Salk Institute', 'Biological Studies', 'lab ’ s discovery', 'eating ”', 'impact obesity', 'chronic diseases', 'improve mood', '~50 %', 'calorie consumption']","748,088"
d29abff8-b2eb-472f-bf9f-74524d024584,How to Optimize Your Water Quality & Intake for Health,"In this episode, I discuss our body’s most vital and essential nutrient—water. I explain the structure of water and how it is used by the cells and tissues of our body, how much water we each need to drink and when in order to optimize our mental focus and physical performance; and I include how exercise, humidity, heat, and caffeine affect our hydration needs. I explain how temperature and pH influence water’s physical properties and if there is any scientific basis for drinking so-called “pH water” or “alkalized water” to improve health. I explain how to test your tap water for contaminants (e.g., endocrine disruptors) and the documented problems with fluoride in drinking water. I provide options for filtering drinking water and describe different water types (e.g., reverse osmosis, hydrogen-enriched, electrolyzed reduced, deuterium depleted, etc.). Since the human body is mostly water (55-80% depending on one’s age) and water has essential roles in health, disease and cellular function, everyone ought to benefit from understanding how best to clean our tap water, hydrate effectively and in some cases, adjust the type of water we drink to allow our brain and body to function optimally in regard to health and performance.

Those listed at the URLs below are meant merely as comparative samples of price range options (~50-$500 depending on volume of water they hold; whole home system of ~$1,000).

ea7af2d5-c9d4-4270-883c-f8fd18226c12,Dr. Oded Rechavi: Genes & the Inheritance of Memories Across Generations,"In this episode, my guest is Oded Rechavi, Ph.D., professor of neurobiology at Tel Aviv University and expert in how genes are inherited, how experiences shape genes and remarkably, how some memories of experiences can be passed via genes to offspring. We discuss his research challenging long-held tenets of genetic inheritance and the relevance of those findings to understanding key biological and psychological processes including metabolism, stress and trauma. He describes the history of the scientific exploration of the “heritability of acquired traits” and how epigenetics and RNA biology can account for some of the passage of certain experience-based memories. He discusses the importance of model organisms in scientific research and describes his work on how stressors and memories can be passed through small RNA molecules to multiple generations of offspring in ways that meaningfully affect their behavior. Nature vs. nurture is a commonly debated theme; Dr. Rechavi’s work represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of that debate, as well as genetic inheritance, brain function and evolution.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-oded-rechavi-genes-and-the-inheritance-of-memories-across-generations/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=128s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=364s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=876s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=1374s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=1732s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=1806s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=2251s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=2713s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=3043s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=3546s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=4143s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=4220s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=4910s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=5162s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=5653s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=5921s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=6470s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=7176s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=7488s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=7882s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=8276s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUetQMKM6g&t=8966s,"00:00:00 Dr. Oded Rechavi; 00:02:08 ROKA, HVMN, Eight Sleep; 00:06:04 DNA, RNA, Protein; Somatic vs. Germ Cells; 00:14:36 Lamarckian Evolution, Inheritance of Acquired Traits; 00:22:54 Paul Kammerer & Toad Morphology; 00:28:52 AG1 (Athletic Greens); 00:30:06 James McConnell & Memory Transfer; 00:37:31 Weismann Barrier; Epigenetics; 00:45:13 Epigenetic Reprogramming; Imprinted Genes; 00:50:43 Nature vs. Nurture; Epigenetics & Offspring; 00:59:06 Generational Epigenetic Inheritance; 01:09:03 InsideTracker; 01:10:20 Model Organisms, C. elegans; 01:21:50 C. elegans & Inheritance of Acquired Traits, Small RNAs; 01:26:02 RNA Interference, C. elegans & Virus Immunity; 01:34:13 RNA Amplification, Multi-Generational Effects; 01:38:41 Response Duration & Environment; 01:47:50 Generational Memory Transmission, RNA; 01:59:36 Germ Cells & Behavior; Body Cues; 02:04:48 Transmission of Sexual Choice; 02:11:22 Fertility & Human Disease; 3-Parent In Vitro Fertilization (IVF); RNA Testing; 02:17:56 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Learning & Memory; 02:29:26 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter",CDUetQMKM6g,870,"['the Inheritance', 'Memories']","['this episode', 'my guest', 'Oded Rechavi', 'Ph.D.', 'professor', 'neurobiology', 'Tel Aviv University', 'expert', 'genes', 'experiences', 'some memories', 'experiences', 'genes', 'offspring', 'We', 'his research', 'long-held tenets', 'genetic inheritance', 'the relevance', 'those findings', 'key biological and psychological processes', 'metabolism', 'stress', 'trauma', 'He', 'the history', 'the scientific exploration', 'the “heritability', 'acquired traits', 'epigenetics', 'RNA biology', 'some', 'the passage', 'certain experience-based memories', 'He', 'the importance', 'model organisms', 'scientific research', 'his work', 'stressors', 'memories', 'small RNA molecules', 'multiple generations', 'offspring', 'ways', 'that', 'their behavior', 'Nature', 'nurture', 'a commonly debated theme', 'a fundamental shift', 'our understanding', 'that debate', 'genetic inheritance', 'brain function', 'evolution', 'guest is Oded Rechavi', 'Tel Aviv University', 'experiences shape genes', 'processes including metabolism', '“ heritability', 'acquired traits ”', 'RNA biology', 'model organisms', 'RNA molecules', 'brain function']","617,531"

I discuss the positive benefits of breathing properly for mood, to reduce psychological and physiological stress, to halt sleep apnea, and improve facial aesthetics and immune system function. I also compare what is known about the effects and effectiveness of different breathing techniques, including physiological sighs, box breathing and cyclic hyperventilation, “Wim Hof Method,” Prānāyāma yogic breathing and more. I also describe how to breath to optimize learning, memory and reaction time and I explain breathing at high altitudes, why “overbreathing” is bad, and how to breathe specifically to relieve cramps and hiccups.

He explains protocols to improve the various kinds of physical endurance: muscular endurance, anerobic capacity, maximum aerobic output, and long duration endurance. He also explains how the body uses different energy sources (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) during rest and exercise. He also explains the mechanisms underlying fat loss and how and why exercise accelerates rates of fat loss. We cover the many concepts related to endurance training and fat loss such as metabolic flexibility, breathwork training for exercise performance and recovery, lactate production and regulation, how to improve blood flow to muscles, anaerobic vs. aerobic metabolism, exercise fatigue, low-carbohydrate diets and fat loss, and how to combine different types of workouts to improve overall endurance. This episode in intended for everyone ranging from novice and recreational exercisers to elite endurance athletes.

I also explain how, regardless of whether you seek to conceive children, optimizing egg and sperm health is directly related to vitality and longevity. I cover the nutrition-based, behavioral, supplement-based and prescription approaches to optimizing egg and sperm health, the ovulatory/menstrual cycle and fertility. In addition, I explain lifestyle choices that greatly assist or harm fertility—several of which are very surprising. I provide science-based protocols for those trying to conceive children. The tools and principles I discuss can also improve overall vitality and longevity in all people, regardless of age.",https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-optimize-fertility-in-males-and-females/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1YRwWmue4Y&t=0s;

5373b9a9-8939-4600-b18c-b4e393fe2a83,Developing a Rational Approach to Supplementation for Health & Performance,"In this episode, I explain how to design a supplementation protocol to support maximum mental and physical health and performance depending on your specific needs, nutrition, lifestyle and finances. When most people hear about “supplements,” they think they are vitamin supplements, but there are many compounds that are powerful and sold over-the-counter that can enhance our health in performance and that can’t be obtained from foods. First, I discuss “foundational” supplements to support overall health, including water and fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, adaptogens, and prebiotics/probiotics. Then I explain how to use single-ingredient supplements to enhance specific aspects of your physiology, such as aiding sleep, cognitive enhancement, and focus supporting healthy hormone levels (e.g., testosterone, estrogen and growth hormone, thyroid). Finally, I explain when it makes sense to add supplements to your lifestyle and discuss how best to use supplements, including how to determine dosage, sourcing, continuous schedules and cycling, and how to layer different supplements most effectively. This episode will explain how to design the safest, most biologically effective, cost-effective supplementation protocol to meet your particular goals and support your overall health, including vitality and longevity.",https://hubermanlab.com/developing-a-rational-approach-to-supplementation-for-health-and-performance/,https://examine.com,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=218s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=711s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=938s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=1267s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=1525s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=1684s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=1986s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=2159s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=2204s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=2315s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=2625s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=3052s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=3355s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=3491s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=3765s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=3833s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=4139s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=4368s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=4564s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=4986s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=5244s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=5454s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=5817s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=5935s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=6238s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=6445s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=6609s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=6925s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI&t=7116s,"00:00:00 Supplements; 00:03:38 Hierarchy of Tools/Interventions, Developing a Supplementation Protocol; 00:11:51 Momentous, LMNT, Helix Sleep; 00:15:38 Role of Supplements, Foundational Supplements, Water/Fat-Soluble Vitamins; 00:21:07 Supplement Considerations: Cost, Nutrition & Schedule; 00:25:25 Foundational Supplements, Digestive Enzymes, Adaptogens; 00:28:04 Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition; 00:33:06 Supplements for Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog; 00:35:59 InsideTracker; 00:36:44 Adaptogens & Broad-Spectrum Foundational Supplements; 00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs; 00:43:45 Supplements to Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine; 00:50:52 Supplements for Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin; 00:55:55 Melatonin Caution; 00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects; 01:02:45 AG1 (Athletic Greens); 01:03:53 Nutrition & Behavior for Hormone Health; 01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root; 01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions; 01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork; 01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido; 01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility; 01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine; 01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine; 01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements; 01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids; 01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein; 01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements; 01:55:25 A Rational Supplementation Protocol; 01:58:36 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter",tLS6t3FVOTI,833,"['a Rational Approach', 'Supplementation', 'Health', 'Performance']","['this episode', 'I', 'a supplementation protocol', 'maximum mental and physical health', 'performance', 'your specific needs', 'nutrition', 'lifestyle', 'finances', 'most people', 'supplements', 'they', 'they', 'vitamin supplements', 'many compounds', 'that', 'the-counter', 'that', 'our health', 'performance', 'that', 'foods', 'I', '“foundational” supplements', 'overall health', 'water and fat-soluble vitamins', 'minerals', 'digestive enzymes', 'adaptogens', 'prebiotics/probiotics', 'I', 'single-ingredient supplements', 'specific aspects', 'your physiology', 'sleep', 'cognitive enhancement', 'healthy hormone levels', 'thyroid', 'I', 'it', 'sense', 'supplements', 'your lifestyle', 'supplements', 'dosage', 'continuous schedules', 'cycling', 'different supplements', 'This episode', 'the safest, most biologically effective, cost-effective supplementation protocol', 'your particular goals', 'your overall health', 'vitality', 'longevity', 'supplementation protocol', '” supplements', 'including water', 'aiding sleep', 'hormone levels', 'growth hormone', 'makes sense', 'add supplements', 'use supplements', 'determine dosage', 'supplementation protocol including vitality']","848,937"
1259a8ca-fcf1-47e7-a9c0-64d5fe9ae707,"Dr. Sam Harris: Using Meditation to Focus, View Consciousness & Expand Your Mind","My guest is Sam Harris, Ph.D. Sam earned his bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Stanford University and his doctorate (Ph.D.) in neuroscience from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He is the author of multiple best-selling books and is a world-renowned public-facing intellectual on meditation, consciousness, free will, psychedelics and neuroscience. He is also the creator of Waking Up and the host of the Making Sense podcast. In this episode, we discuss meditation as a route to understanding “the self” and experiencing consciousness, not just changing one’s conscious state. Sam describes several meditation techniques and their benefits, including how meditation fundamentally changes our worldview and how it can be merged seamlessly into daily life. It can help us overcome universal challenges such as distractibility and persistent, internal dialogue (“chatter”) to allow for deep contentment and pervasive shifts in our awareness, all while acknowledging the more immediate stress-lowering and memory-improving effects of meditation. We also discuss the therapeutic use of psychedelics and the mechanistic similarities between the benefits of a psychedelic journey and long-term meditation practices. And we discuss the rationale behind Sam’s recent decision to close his social media (Twitter) account. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about the higher order functions of the brain, the brain-body connection, consciousness and, of course, meditation and why and how to meditate for maximum benefit.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-sam-harris-using-meditation-to-focus-view-consciousness-and-expand-your-mind/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wIt_WsJGfw&t=0s;

We discuss how people can build and sculpt their identity and psychology through specific mindsets and actions and how to adapt the self to novel and challenging situations, using specific daily routines. We consider how “energy” actually stems from physical action and describe practical tools and scientific mechanisms for leveraging exercise, cold exposure, nutrition, fasting, hydration, sunlight, mindset and music to make us feel more energized and what that, in turn, does for our life. Jocko explains how discipline and specific daily routines allow for productivity and creativity. And we discuss the qualities of successful leaders, including how to build confidence and real bonds when working with a team or family/friends. Jocko describes a particularly powerful tool of using perspective shifts to allow for ‘detachment’- as a unique way to identify novel solutions to problems. We also discuss the power of early developmental narratives and how experiences of friendship, love, connection and loss can serve as pillars for making us better human beings in all aspects of life. Our conversation covers a wide range of topics, including mental health, physical health and performance, and provides actionable tools that anyone, regardless of age or profession, can apply to live a more effective and meaningful life.",https://hubermanlab.com/jocko-willink-how-to-become-resilient-forge-your-identity-and-lead-others/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RAXBLt1iM&t=0s;

e771b226-9ff5-40c1-babf-a66d4747e4d9,The Science of Creativity & How to Enhance Creative Innovation,"In this episode, I explain how the brain engages in creative thinking and, based on that mechanistic understanding, the tools to improve one’s ability to think creatively and innovate in any area. I discuss how convergent and divergent thinking are essential for generating creative ideas and provide three types of meditation tools (open monitoring meditation, focused attention meditation & non-sleep deep rest; NSDR), which improve our ability to engage in these creative thinking patterns in specific and powerful ways. I also discuss how dopamine and mood contribute to the creative process and describe behavioral, nutritional and supplementation-based approaches for increasing dopamine to engage in creative thought and implementation. I explain how movement and storytelling (narrative) approaches can generate novel creative ideas and how substances like alcohol, cannabis, and psilocybin impact our creative ability. Excitingly, creativity is a skill that can be cultivated and enhanced; this episode outlines many tools to help anyone access creativity and apply creative patterns of thought to different domains of life.",https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-creativity-and-how-to-enhance-creative-innovation/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=270s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=531s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=676s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=1417s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=1918s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=1993s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=2529s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=2801s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=3422s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=3486s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=4058s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=4266s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=4560s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=5021s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=5415s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=6193s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=6553s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=6724s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=6885s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=7262s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPlJcD-o-4Q&t=8087s,"00:00:00 Creativity; 00:04:30 ROKA, Thesis, LMNT, Momentous; 00:08:51 What is Creativity?; 00:11:16 Creativity in Visual Arts, Escher & Banksy; 00:23:37 Neural Circuits of Creativity; 00:31:58 AG1 (Athletic Greens); 00:33:13 Creative Ideas & Divergent Thinking; 00:42:09 Testing Creative Ideas & Convergent Thinking; 00:46:41 Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways; 00:57:02 InsideTracker; 00:58:06 Tool: Open Monitoring Meditation & Divergent Thinking; 01:07:38 Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking; 01:11:06 Mood, Creativity & Dopamine; 01:16:00 Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine; 01:23:41 Dopamine Supplementation; L-Tyrosine, Caffeine; 01:30:15 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest, Mesocortical Dopamine & Divergent Thinking; 01:43:13 Serotonin, Psylocibin & Creative Thinking; 01:49:13 Alcohol & Autobiographical Scripting; Cannabis; 01:52:04 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Creativity; 01:54:45 Tool: Movement & Divergent Thinking; 02:01:02 Tool: Narratives & Storytelling for Creativity; 02:14:47 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media",KPlJcD-o-4Q,503,"['The Science', 'Creativity', 'Creative Innovation']","['this episode', 'I', 'the brain', 'creative thinking', 'that mechanistic understanding', 'one’s ability', 'any area', 'I', 'convergent', 'divergent thinking', 'creative ideas', 'three types', 'meditation tools', 'open monitoring meditation', 'attention meditation & non-sleep deep rest', 'which', 'our ability', 'these creative thinking patterns', 'specific and powerful ways', 'I', 'dopamine', 'mood', 'the creative process', 'behavioral, nutritional and supplementation-based approaches', 'dopamine', 'creative thought', 'implementation', 'I', '(narrative', 'novel creative ideas', 'substances', 'alcohol', 'cannabis', 'our creative ability', 'creativity', 'a skill', 'that', 'this episode', 'many tools', 'anyone', 'creativity', 'creative patterns', 'thought', 'different domains', 'life', '’ s ability', 'divergent thinking', 'meditation tools', 'monitoring meditation', 'focused attention meditation', 'thinking patterns', 'mood contribute', 'increasing dopamine', 'help anyone access creativity']","294,067"

We discuss how to optimize male hormones using a range of nutritional and behavioral tools, exercise, and supplementation (including discussions on tongkat ali, fadogia agrestis, creatine, peptides and more). We explain how puberty and aging affect hormone levels, how to use bloodwork to monitor hormone levels, how hormone health impacts fertility, libido, hair loss, and prostate health, and describe behaviors that negatively impact testosterone levels. We also discuss how to safely and rationally approach prescription hormone therapies, including which biomarkers to monitor when using these approaches and how to optimize synergistic hormones (e.g., growth hormone and thyroid hormone) to support complete hormone health. Dr. Gillett offers numerous actionable tools that can be tailored to specific goals and age ranges to attain and maintain optimal levels of male hormones for overall health, well-being and longevity.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-kyle-gillett-tools-for-hormone-optimization-in-males/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=220s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=463s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=914s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=1037s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=1334s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=1703s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=1939s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=2048s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=2435s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=2912s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=2986s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=3492s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=3662s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=4305s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=4534s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=4599s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=4929s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=5192s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=5512s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=5636s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=6126s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=6423s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=6776s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=6930s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=7568s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=7796s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=8293s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8&t=8515s,"00:00:00 Dr. Kyle Gillett & Male Hormone Optimization; 00:03:40 Thesis, ROKA, Helix Sleep, Momentous; 00:07:43 Puberty: Height, Resistance Training, Childhood Obesity; 00:15:14 “First” vs. “Second” Puberty; 00:17:17 Hormone Optimization & Blood Work; 00:22:14 Diet, Exercise, Sleep & Hormones; 00:28:23 Hormones, Stress, Social Connection & Purpose; 00:32:19 Hormones, Supplementation & Medication; 00:34:08 Determining Individual Hormone Levels, ADAM Questionnaire; 00:40:35 Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & the Dopamine “Wave Pool”; 00:48:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens); 00:49:46 Sustainable Exercise Regimen for Hormone Health; 00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT); 01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic); 01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone; 01:15:34 InsideTracker; 01:16:39 Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia; Longjack) & Steroid Pathways; 01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone; 01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise; 01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens; 01:33:56 Peptides: Growth Hormone, Tesamorelin, Ibutamoren & Gut Microbiome; 01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy; 01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene; 01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature; 01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat; 02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA); 02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids; 02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health; 02:21:55 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter",O640yAgq5f8,853,"['Tools', 'Hormone Optimization', 'Males', 'Hormone Optimization']","['My guest', 'MD', 'a dual board-certified physician', 'family medicine', 'obesity medicine', 'an expert', 'hormone levels', 'overall health', 'We', 'male hormones', 'a range', 'nutritional and behavioral tools', 'exercise', 'supplementation', 'discussions', 'fadogia agrestis', 'creatine', 'peptides', 'We', 'how puberty', 'aging', 'hormone levels', 'bloodwork', 'hormone levels', 'libido', 'hair loss', 'prostate health', 'behaviors', 'that', 'testosterone levels', 'We', 'prescription hormone therapies', 'these approaches', 'synergistic hormones', 'complete hormone health', 'numerous actionable tools', 'that', 'specific goals', 'age', 'optimal levels', 'male hormones', 'overall health', 'well-being', 'longevity', 'family medicine', 'obesity medicine', 'optimizing hormone levels', 'optimize male hormones', 'including discussions', 'hormone levels', 'use bloodwork', 'monitor hormone levels', 'health impacts fertility', 'hair loss', 'prostate health', 'impact testosterone levels', 'prescription hormone therapies', 'growth hormone', 'hormone health', 'male hormones']","806,360"

I explain how caffeine powerfully reinforces the consumption of certain foods and drinks—thereby increasing how much we like their tastes and seek them out. I discuss the mechanisms by which caffeine increases focus, alertness and mood and reduces sleepiness. I also explain many practical tools for caffeine use, including delaying caffeine intake after waking, intermittent caffeine use, during fasting, before and during exercise, and the use of theanine to curb jitters caused by caffeine. I also discuss the positive effects of caffeine on overall health and longevity and address several myths about caffeine.

He explains the important connection between nutrition, metabolism and mental health and his pioneering work using the ketogenic diet to successfully treat patients with various mental illnesses, including depression and schizophrenia. Dr. Palmer explains how the ketogenic diet is an evidenced-based treatment for epilepsy, mimics the fasted state and can offset the cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s. He describes the key roles of mitochondria in mental health, how certain conditions likely arise from mitochondrial dysfunction, and how low-carbohydrate diets increase mitochondrial turnover to improve mental health. He also explains how low-carbohydrate diets positively impact the gut microbiome and weight loss, important risk factors for mitochondrial health such as marijuana and alcohol, and the best way to increase circulating ketones depending on individual needs. We also cover how a ketogenic diet impacts mood, sleep, and fertility. Dr. Palmer’s work stands as a revolutionary approach to mental health and disease that, given the prevalence of mental health challenges, should be of interest to people of all backgrounds and ages.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-chris-palmer-diet-nutrition-for-mental-health/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=205s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=438s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=1243s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=1672s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=2072s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=2138s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=2555s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=2811s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=3370s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=3425s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=3944s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=4512s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=4583s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=5109s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=5514s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=6000s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=6394s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=6921s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=7265s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=7587s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=7816s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=8625s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=9347s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=9997s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=10343s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjEFo3a1AnI&t=10861s,"00:00:00 Dr. Chris Palmer, Mental Health & Metabolic Disorders; 00:03:25 Thesis, Eight Sleep, ROKA; 00:07:18 Nutrition & Mental Health; 00:20:43 Low-Carb Diets & Anti-Depression, Fasting, Ketosis; 00:27:52 Schizophrenia, Depression & Ketogenic Diet; 00:34:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens); 00:35:38 Psychiatric Mediations, Diet Adherence; 00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits; 00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment; 00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health; 00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits for Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders; 01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health; 01:15:12 InsideTracker; 01:16:23 Mitophagy, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Aging & Diet; 01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose; 01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria; 01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana; 01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet; 01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones; 02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet; 02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose; 02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet; 02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss; 02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep; 02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility; 02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications; 03:01:01 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media",xjEFo3a1AnI,1121,"['Diet', 'Nutrition', 'Mental Health']","['My guest', 'this episode', 'M.D.', 'a board-certified psychiatrist', 'professor', 'psychiatry', 'Harvard Medical School', 'He', 'the important connection', 'nutrition', 'metabolism', 'mental health', 'his pioneering work', 'the ketogenic diet', 'patients', 'various mental illnesses', 'depression', 'schizophrenia', 'the ketogenic diet', 'an evidenced-based treatment', 'epilepsy', 'the fasted state', 'the cognitive decline', 'Alzheimer', 'He', 'the key roles', 'mitochondria', 'mental health', 'certain conditions', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'how low-carbohydrate diets', 'mitochondrial turnover', 'mental health', 'He', 'low-carbohydrate diets', 'the gut microbiome', 'weight loss', 'important risk factors', 'mitochondrial health', 'alcohol', 'the best way', 'circulating ketones', 'individual needs', 'We', 'mood', 'sleep', 'fertility', 'a revolutionary approach', 'mental health', 'disease', 'that', 'the prevalence', 'mental health challenges', 'interest', 'people', 'all backgrounds', 'ages', 'assistant professor', 'Harvard Medical School', 'pioneering work', 'treat patients', 'including depression', 'Alzheimer ’ s', 'gut microbiome', 'risk factors', 'increase circulating ketones', 'impacts mood', 'health challenges']","4,400,931"

8f12c52b-2c7f-4de3-9eba-7b224838c949,How Meditation Works & Science-Based Effective Meditations,"In this episode, I discuss the biological mechanisms of the state changes that occur during different types of meditation and describe how to develop the meditation practice optimal for you. I explain key meditation principles, such as using specific breathwork patterns and adjusting your perception to specific locations along the continuum between interoception, exteroception and dissociation. I discuss how meditation practices lead to long-term trait changes and neuroplasticity, including changing your default mood, reducing baseline anxiety/depression, increasing your ability to focus, enhancing relaxation, improving sleep, and increasing your overall happiness level.  I also explain the concept behind the “third-eye center,” what mindfulness is from a biological standpoint, the power of ultra-brief meditations and how to select the best meditation and time and duration to meditate to meet your need. I also explain a novel open-eyed perception-based meditation that may enhance focus, relaxation and task-switching ability. Whether you are a novice or an experienced meditator or simply interested in how our brain controls different aspects of conscious awareness and self-regulation, this episode should interest you.",https://hubermanlab.com/how-meditation-works-and-science-based-effective-meditations/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=253s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=505s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=979s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=1567s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=1947s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=2021s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=2540s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=3210s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=3708s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=4055s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=4230s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=4846s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=5050s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=5441s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=5962s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=6463s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=6819s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=7218s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=7893s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=8093s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY&t=8700s,"00:00:00 Meditation; 00:04:13 InsideTracker, Thesis, ROKA, Momentous Supplements; 00:08:25 Brief History of Meditation: Consciousness, Psychedelics, fMRI; 00:16:19 How the Brain Interprets the Body & Surrounding Environment; Mindfulness; 00:26:07 Neuroscience of Meditation; Perceptual Spotlights; 00:32:27 AG1 (Athletic Greens); 00:33:41 Interoception vs. Exteroception; 00:42:20 Default Mode Network, Continuum of Interoception & Exteroception; 00:53:30 Tools: Interoceptive or Exteroceptive Bias, Meditation Challenge; 01:01:48 State & Trait Changes, Interoceptive & Exteroceptive Meditations, Refocusing; 01:07:35 Tool: Brief Meditations, Waking Up App; 01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts; 01:20:46 Meditation: Practice Types, Focal Points & Consistency; 01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception; 01:30:41 Tool: Meditation Breathwork, Cyclic vs. Complex Breathwork; 01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma; 01:47:43 Model of Interoception & Dissociation Continuum; 01:53:39 Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge; 02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR); 02:11:33 Choosing a Meditative Practice; Hypnosis; 02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB); 02:25:00 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media",wTBSGgbIvsY,1101,['How Meditation Works & Science-Based Effective Meditations'],"['this episode', 'I', 'the biological mechanisms', 'the state changes', 'that', 'different types', 'meditation', 'the meditation practice', 'you', 'I', 'key meditation principles', 'specific breathwork patterns', 'your perception', 'specific locations', 'interoception', 'exteroception', 'dissociation', 'I', 'meditation practices', 'long-term trait changes', 'neuroplasticity', 'your default mood', 'baseline anxiety/depression', 'your ability', 'relaxation', 'sleep', 'your overall happiness level', 'I', 'the concept', 'the “third-eye center', 'what mindfulness', 'a biological standpoint', 'ultra-brief meditations', 'the best meditation', 'time', 'duration', 'your need', 'I', 'a novel open-eyed perception-based meditation', 'that', 'focus', 'relaxation', 'task-switching ability', 'you', 'a novice', 'an experienced meditator', 'our brain', 'different aspects', 'conscious awareness', 'self-regulation', 'this episode', 'you', 'state changes', 'meditation practice optimal', 'meditation principles', 'breathwork patterns', 'meditation practices', 'trait changes', 'default mood', 'enhancing relaxation', 'improving sleep', 'enhance focus', 'brain controls']","3,243,824"

I discuss fundamentals of resistance training protocols, including repetitions, sets, inter-set and inter-workout rest periods and periodization of intensity and volume to improve strength and hypertrophy. I also explain how to integrate this with endurance training across the week by controlling the duration, timing and intensity of cardiovascular workouts. I also cover science-based protocols on leveraging the mind-body connection, deliberate breathing (during and after exercise), stretching, deliberate heat and cold exposure, and non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) for better workout performance and faster recovery. Further, I tackle a range of real-world issues that can affect a consistent training schedule, such as whether you should train if you are sick, have had a poor night of sleep or had a stressful event and how to start training again after a break and whether you should train in a fasted or fed state. Physical fitness is a key variable for immediate and long-term health.

He is also the Director of the Stanford Brain Stimulation Lab. We discuss clinical applications for brain stimulation, behavioral protocols and novel drug treatments to halt and reverse mental health disorders, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We first discuss the neural circuits for self-identity and mood and stress control. We discuss Dr. Williams’ work using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to depression, trauma, PTSD, and other mood disorders. We then dive deep into the history, biology, modern use, and safety margins of the various psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, ketamine, ibogaine, ayahuasca, and psilocybin, as well as cannabis and the use of SSRIs in both adults and children. Finally, we discuss behavioral treatments for mental health disorders, including sleep and sleep deprivation, light exposure, exercise, and training to control the brain-heart-rate pathways. Regardless of age, all those interested in mental health should benefit from the incredible breadth and depth of Dr. Williams’ knowledge and the clarity with which he conveys that information.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-nolan-williams-psychedelics-and-neurostimulation-for-brain-rewiring/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4QE6t-MkYE&t=0s;

4f1602d9-c8fe-4c65-a01a-bb0648117a92,The Effects of Cannabis (Marijuana) on the Brain & Body,"In this episode, I discuss cannabis (aka marijuana), including the biological mechanisms underlying its effects on the mind and body, its known medical applications, its impact on libido, creativity, hunger, hormones and more. I also cover the known adverse health consequences of chronic and even acute (one-time) use and the factors that determine if cannabis is helpful or harmful. Additionally, I detail how the various strains of cannabis: sativa, indica and hybrid strains, can produce such divergent effects depending on the strain type, THC-to-CBD ratio, total dosage, and frequency of use. I review why cannabis can impact speech patterns and one’s propensity to develop anxiety/depression during and after use and, in some individuals, paranoia. As the legal landscape for cannabis is rapidly evolving, this episode should interest a wide audience, including former/current cannabis users, those in the medical, sports, law enforcement, and educational communities and, of course, children, teenagers, and parents.",https://hubermanlab.com/the-effects-of-cannabis-marijuana-on-the-brain-and-body/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=286s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=423s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=608s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=841s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=908s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=1174s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=1555s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=1841s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=1916s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=2435s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=2594s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=3187s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=3389s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=3898s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=4181s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=4568s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=5201s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=5708s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=6406s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=7015s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=7613s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=7806s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=8293s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=8757s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=9276s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=9704s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=9894s,"00:00:00 Cannabis (Marijuana); 00:04:46 New: Huberman Lab Premium Membership; 00:07:03 Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Sleep & Anxiety; 00:10:08 Levels, Thesis, InsideTracker; 00:14:01 Momentous Supplements; 00:15:08 Cannabis Strains, Psychoactive Compounds: THC & CBD; 00:19:34 Sativa vs. Indica, Stimulant vs. Relaxation Effects; 00:25:55 Hybrid Cannabis Strains, Type 1, 2 & 3 Strains; 00:30:41 AG1 (Athletic Greens); 00:31:56 Naturally Occurring Receptors: Nicotinic & Cannabinoid Receptors (CB1); 00:40:35 THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence; 00:43:14 Endogenous Cannabinoids, Cannabinoid Receptors & Nervous System Function; 00:53:07 Biological Effects of Cannabis; 00:56:29 Cannabis Sativa & Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia; 01:04:58 Cannabis Indica & Subjective Effects, Memory, Dosage; 01:09:41 Brain Areas Affected by THC & CBD, Side Effects; 01:16:08 Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking & Dopamine; 01:26:41 Does Cannabis Increase Creativity?; 01:35:08 Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes in Speech Patterns; 01:46:46 Cannabis & Libido, Dopamine & Prolactin; 01:56:55 Cannabis & Hormones: Prolactin, Testosterone, Estrogen & Fertility; 02:06:53 Smoking/Vaping Tobacco or Cannabis & Negative Health Consequences; 02:10:06 Avoiding Cannabis During Pregnancy/Breastfeeding, Fetal Neural Development; 02:18:13 Negative Health Consequences of Cannabis, Anxiety & Depression, Tolerance; 02:25:57 Cannabis Use & Adolescence/Young Adulthood, Predisposition to Psychosis; 02:34:36 Adolescent Cannabis Use: Brain Development & Mental Health Disorders; 02:41:44 Cannabis & Pain Management, Divergent Effects of Cannabis; 02:44:54 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Premium Channel, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn",gXvuJu1kt48,1174,"['The Effects', 'Cannabis', 'the Brain', 'Body']","['this episode', 'I', 'cannabis', 'the biological mechanisms', 'its effects', 'the mind', 'body', 'its known medical applications', 'its impact', 'libido', 'creativity', 'hunger', 'hormones', 'I', 'the known adverse health consequences', 'chronic and even acute (one-time) use', 'the factors', 'that', 'cannabis', 'I', 'the various strains', 'cannabis', 'sativa', 'strains', 'such divergent effects', 'the strain type', 'CBD', 'total dosage', 'frequency', 'use', 'I', 'cannabis', 'speech patterns', 'one’s propensity', 'anxiety/depression', 'use', 'some individuals', 'the legal landscape', 'cannabis', 'this episode', 'a wide audience', 'former/current cannabis users', 'those', 'sports', 'law enforcement', 'educational communities', 'course', 'children', 'teenagers', 'parents', 'discuss cannabis', 'health consequences', 'strain type', 'THC-to-CBD ratio', 'impact speech patterns', '’ s propensity', 'develop anxiety/depression', 'cannabis users', 'law enforcement']","2,544,042"

Dr. Halpern’s research and clinical practice focus on using deep brain stimulation to treat compulsive and movement disorders (e.g., binge eating disorders, bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Parkinson’s disease essential tremor, dystonia). We discuss using deep brain stimulation to help patients who suffer from movement and compulsive disorders and applying this treatment to patients afflicted with binge eating. We also explore applications of this technology to other conditions such as OCD, anorexia and tremor, and the future therapeutic directions of the use of non-invasive brain stimulation approaches, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and ultrasound, for the treatment of other psychiatric illnesses and conditions.

I discuss nicotine’s ability to increase the action of neurochemicals, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine and activate sympathetic (alertness-promoting) neural circuits. I also discuss common nicotine delivery methods, such as cigarettes, vaping, dip, and snuff, and how they each create their own unique experience and how they, but not nicotine itself, cause cancer and other adverse health effects. I also explain science-based tools to permanently quit smoking cigarettes or vaping, including peer-reviewed clinical hypnosis tools, antidepressants, and alternative nicotine replacement (patches, lozenges, gums etc.).

Dr. Anderson is a Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a member of the National Academy of Sciences and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). We discuss how states of mind (and body) arise and persist and how they probably better explain human behavior than emotions per se. We also discuss the many kinds of arousal that create varying levels of pressure for certain behaviors to emerge. We discuss different types of violent aggression and how they are impacted by biological sex, gender, context, prior experience, and hormones, and the neural interconnectedness of fear, aggression and sexual behavior. We also discuss peptides and their role in social isolation-induced anxiety and aggression. Dr. Anderson also describes novel, potentially powerful therapeutics for mental health.

I explain science-supported strategies for transitioning into focus, maintaining focus during the work bout, and exiting the focus session, which is also critical, including decompression/defocusing tools. I explain when and how to use: binaural beats, caffeine, deliberate cold exposure, the pros and cons of working in fasted vs. fed states, and supplements and foods that enhance dopamine, epinephrine (i.e., adrenaline) and acetylcholine to promote optimal focus. Also, I explain how short behavioral practices, such as meditation and visual gaze training, will benefit your ability to focus over the long term. As deep focus is crucial to significantly improve cognitive or physical performance in any realm, this episode should be useful to anyone.

Dr. Jarvis’ research spans the molecular and genetic mechanisms of vocal communication, comparative genomics of speech and language across species and the relationship between speech, language and movement. We discuss the unique ability of humans (and certain animal species) to learn and communicate using complex language, including verbal speech production and the ability to interpret both written and spoken language. We also discuss the connections between language, singing and dance and why song may have evolved before language. Dr. Jarvis also explains some of the underlying biological and genetic components of stutter/speech disorders, non-verbal communication, why it’s easiest to learn a language as a child and how individuals can learn multiple languages at any age.

I also describe genetic differences that predispose certain individuals to alcoholism, binge and habit-drinking. I explain alcohol metabolism in simple terms and how it effectively acts as a poison, leading to cellular stress and damage. I then explain that it impacts neuronal function and changes our thinking and behavior – hallmarks of inebriation. I also discuss how alcohol consumption of different amounts impacts inflammation, stress, neurodegeneration, and cancer risk and negatively impacts the gut microbiome, brain thickness, hormone balance, mood and feelings of motivation. Additionally, I discuss the biology of hangovers and describe science-based strategies to mitigate the severity of a hangover. Since alcohol is one of the most widely consumed recreational substances, this episode ought to be of relevance to everyone.  Indeed, even low-to-moderate alcohol consumption negatively impacts the brain and body in direct ways.

4ff355ce-08a5-4948-952a-536172913261,The Science & Treatment of Bipolar Disorder,"In this episode, I explain the biology, symptoms, causes and types of bipolar disorder (sometimes called bipolar depression). I discuss neuroplasticity and how the brain normally regulates mood, energy, and perceptions; then, I contrast that with the biology of bipolar disorder, which is characterized by extremes of energy and mood, e.g., mania and depression. I outline the mechanisms through which bipolar disorder manifests in the brain, including deficits of interoception and reduced connections between the parietal and limbic systems. I also outline how treatment options (such as lithium) work in part through homeostatic plasticity.’ I discuss not only lithium but also the treatment of bipolar with ketamine, different talk therapies, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and nutraceuticals, including Omega-3 and Inositol supplementation. This episode should interest anyone who has or knows someone with bipolar disorder and, more broadly, those interested in how the brain works to create a balance between thoughts, energy levels, focus, and mood.",https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-treatment-of-bipolar-disorder/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=143s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=222s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=623s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=864s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=990s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=1738s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=1987s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=2300s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=2813s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=3111s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=3186s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=3764s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=3905s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=4210s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=4631s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=4978s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=5760s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=6198s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=6481s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=6710s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=7411s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=7604s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=8133s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI&t=8265s,"00:00:00 Bipolar Disorder; 00:02:23 Momentous Supplements; 00:03:42 Tool: Appetite Suppression & GLP-1, Parallel Pathways, Yerba Mate; 00:10:23 InsideTracker, ROKA, Blinkist; 00:14:24 Prevalence & Severity of Bipolar Disorder; 00:16:30 Bipolar Disorder I, Diagnostic Criteria of Mania; 00:28:58 Bipolar Disorder II, Individual Variability; 00:33:07 Bipolar I vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States; 00:38:20 Consequences of Bipolar Disorder, Heritability; 00:46:53 Bipolar Disorder vs. Borderline Personality Disorder; 00:51:51 Mania & Depression, Negative Impacts; 00:53:06 History of Lithium Treatment; 01:02:44 Lithium Treatment & Side-Effects; 01:05:05 Effects of Lithium: BDNF, Anti-inflammatory & Neuroprotection; 01:10:10 Neural Circuits of Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity; 01:17:11 Neural States & Mania, Parietal Lobe & Limbic System; 01:22:58 Homeostatic Plasticity, Synaptic Scaling, Lithium & Ketamine; 01:36:00 Talk Therapies: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Family-Focused Therapy, Interpersonal & Social Rhythm Therapy; 01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS); 01:48:01 Psylocibin, Cannabis; 01:51:50 Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids; 02:03:31 Omega-3s, Membrane Fluidity & Neuroplasticity; 02:06:44 Mania, Creativity & Occupations; 02:15:33 Bipolar Disorder: Diagnosis, Neural Circuits & Treatment; 02:17:45 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter",m_OazsImOiI,1019,"['The Science', 'Treatment', 'Bipolar Disorder']","['this episode', 'I', 'the biology', 'symptoms', 'causes', 'types', 'bipolar disorder', 'bipolar depression', 'I', 'neuroplasticity', 'the brain', 'mood', 'energy', 'perceptions', 'I', 'the biology', 'bipolar disorder', 'which', 'extremes', 'energy', 'mood', 'I', 'the mechanisms', 'which', 'the brain', 'deficits', 'interoception', 'reduced connections', 'the parietal and limbic systems', 'I', 'treatment options', 'lithium', 'part', 'homeostatic plasticity', 'I', 'not only lithium', 'the treatment', 'electroconvulsive therapy', 'transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'nutraceuticals', 'Omega-3 and Inositol supplementation', 'This episode', 'anyone', 'who', 'someone', 'bipolar disorder', 'those', 'the brain', 'a balance', 'thoughts', 'energy levels', 'mood', 'discuss neuroplasticity', 'regulates mood', 'disorder manifests', 'including deficits', 'treatment options', 'plasticity. ’', 'talk therapies', 'including Omega-3', 'Inositol supplementation', 'interest anyone', 'knows someone', 'energy levels']","661,075"

Dr. Zuker is the world’s leading expert in the biology of taste, thirst and craving. His laboratory explores the mechanisms of taste perception, focusing on how our conscious and unconscious processing of specific foods and nutrients guide our actions and behaviors. We discuss the neural circuits of taste,  the “gut-brain axis,” the basis of food cravings and the key difference between wanting (craving) and liking (perceiving) sugar. We also explore how taste perception relates to specific food satiety, thirst, to our emotions, and expectation. We also consider how sugar containing and highly-processed foods can hijack the natural balance of the taste and digestive systems. Dr. Zuker provides a true masterclass in the biology of taste and perception that ought to be of interest to anyone curious about how the brain works, our motivated behaviors and the neural, chemical perceptual aspects of the mind.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-charles-zuker-the-biology-of-taste-perception-and-sugar-craving/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=185s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=275s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=515s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=708s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=980s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=1219s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=1578s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=1680s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=1814s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=2042s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=2374s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=2574s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=3115s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=3376s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=3704s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=4154s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=4646s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=5045s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=5290s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=5783s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=6189s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=6723s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=6846s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=7050s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=7313s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=7838s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg&t=8158s,"00:00:00 Dr. Charles Zuker & Taste Perception; 00:03:05 Momentous Supplements; 00:04:35 Thesis, ROKA, Helix Sleep; 00:08:35 Sensory Detection vs. Sensory Perception; 00:11:48 Individual Variations within Perception, Color; 00:16:20 Perceptions & Behaviors; 00:20:19 The 5 Taste Modalities; 00:26:18 Aversive Taste, Bitter Taste; 00:28:00 Survival-Based & Evolutionary Reasons for Taste Modalities, Taste vs. Flavor; 00:30:14 Additional Taste Modalities: Fat & Metallic Perception; 00:34:02 Tongue “Taste Map,” Taste Buds & Taste Receptors; 00:39:34 Burning Your Tongue & Perception; 00:42:54 The “Meaning” of Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence; 00:51:55 Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior; 00:56:16 Acquired Tastes, Conditioned Taste Aversion; 01:01:44 Olfaction (Smell) vs. Taste, Changing Tastes over One’s Lifetime; 01:09:14 Integration of Odor & Taste, Influence on Behavior & Emotion; 01:17:26 Sensitization to Taste, Internal State Modulation, Salt; 01:24:05 Taste & Saliva: The Absence of Taste; 01:28:10 Sugar & Reward Pleasure Centers; Gut-Brain Axis, Anticipatory Response; 01:36:23 Vagus Nerve; 01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis; 01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite; 01:54:06 Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis; 01:57:30 Nutrition, Gut-Brain Axis & Changes in Behavior; 02:01:53 Fast vs. Slow Signaling & Reinforcement, Highly Processed Foods; 02:10:38 Favorite Foods: Enjoyment, Sensation & Context; 02:15:58 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter",UChhXiFPRgg,403,"['The Biology', 'Taste Perception & Sugar Craving', 'Taste Perception']","['My guest', 'this episode', 'PhD', 'Professor', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biophysics', 'Neuroscience', 'Columbia University', 'an Investigator', 'the Howard Hughes Medical Institute', 'HHMI', 'the world’s leading expert', 'the biology', 'taste', 'thirst', 'craving', 'His laboratory', 'the mechanisms', 'taste perception', 'our conscious and unconscious processing', 'specific foods', 'nutrients', 'our actions', 'behaviors', 'We', 'the neural circuits', 'taste', 'the “gut-brain axis', 'the basis', 'food cravings', 'the key difference', 'craving', 'sugar', 'We', 'taste perception', 'specific food satiety', 'our emotions', 'We', 'how sugar', 'highly-processed foods', 'the natural balance', 'the taste and digestive systems', 'a true masterclass', 'the biology', 'taste', 'perception', 'that', 'interest', 'anyone', 'the brain', 'our motivated behaviors', 'the neural, chemical perceptual aspects', 'the mind', 'Molecular Biophysics', 'Columbia University', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute', 'world ’ s leading expert', 'taste perception', 'gut-brain axis', 'food cravings', 'taste perception specific food satiety', 'sugar containing']","149,693"
0922a31a-b88e-4c7a-a188-8421b7b74326,Optimize & Control Your Brain Chemistry to Improve Health & Performance,"In this episode, I explain the biological roles of the four major neuromodulators—dopamine, epinephrine (aka adrenaline), serotonin, and acetylcholine—and describe how these neuromodulators impact a wide variety of mental states and behaviors, including focus, creativity, motivation, drive, learning, alertness, mood, relationships, and feelings of well-being. Then, with that foundational understanding in mind, I describe a potent toolkit of science-supported behavioral, nutrition, and supplementation tools that can be used to increase baseline levels of individual neuromodulators and that can be modified for specific goals. This episode summarizes low-or-no-cost, actionable, science-based tools that can benefit anyone in order to enhance their levels of brain chemicals and improve mental health, physical health, and performance.

2e4fd1df-f7ed-4039-b542-788c8b291275,The Science & Treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD),"In this episode, I explain the biology and psychology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)—a prevalent and debilitating condition. I also discuss the efficacy and mechanisms behind OCD treatments—both behavioral and pharmacologic as well as holistic and combination treatments and new emerging treatments, including directed brain stimulation. I explain the neural circuitry underlying repetitive “thought-action loops” and why in OCD, the compulsive actions merely make the obsessions even stronger. I review cognitive-behavioral therapies like exposure therapy and SSRIs, holistic approaches, and nutraceuticals, detailing the efficacy of each approach and what science says about how to combine and sequence treatments. I describe an often effective approach for treating OCD where clinicians use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to deliberately bring patients into states of high anxiety while encouraging them to suppress compulsive actions in order to help them learn to overcome repetitious thought/action cycles. This episode should interest anyone with OCD, anyone who knows someone with OCD or OCPD, and more generally, those interested in how the brain works to control thoughts and actions, whether those thoughts are intrusive or not.

7a4df084-17c4-455c-8bd2-ecbe717acd0c,Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols,"In this episode, I explain the science behind limb range of motion and flexibility and how to increase them by using science-supported protocols. Flexibility is crucial for physical movements and can help prevent injuries, decrease inflammation, modulate physical and mental pain, impact exercise recovery speed and even potentially slow the progression of certain diseases. I explain the biology of flexibility, including the specific neural mechanisms that sense stretch and load (i.e., tension) on the muscles and limbs, as well as how specific brain regions like the insula combine those signals to ultimately control limb range of movement. I also provide science-based stretching and “micro-stretching” protocols that reliably improve limb flexibility with the minimum necessary time investment.

f8d7b646-c088-4bdf-baa3-df03489b3b84,The Science & Process of Healing from Grief,"This episode, I discuss grief and the challenges of processing losses of different kinds. I explain the biological mechanisms of grief, including how neural circuits for emotional and factual memory combine with those for love and attachment, to create feelings of absence and yearning. I discuss how grief is distinct from depression, yet why they can feel so similar. I also provide science-based tools to assist with the grieving process, including how to reframe and remap the relationship with those we have lost while still maintaining a strong emotional connection to them. I also explain the importance of having and building strong foundational psychological and biological states so that we can better cope with grief when it happens. Finally, I describe tools to adjust those states, including those for accessing sleep, managing stress and emotional swings. This episode is for those suffering from grief but also for everyone, given that we all experience grief at some point in our lives. We recorded this episode before the recent mass shooting tragedies in the United States. While we hope the information in this episode will be of use to anyone suffering from grief of any kind and at any time, we are also careful to acknowledge that many people require additional support and resources. For that reason, we include mention of such resources and we generally hope people will access them if needed.

911fdae7-ea47-4825-8af1-074f5be732df,Understand & Improve Memory Using Science-Based Tools￼,"This episode I explain the mechanisms by which different types of memories are established in our brain and how to leverage the amount and timing of key neurochemicals and hormones, such as adrenaline (aka epinephrine) and cortisol, to improve your learning and memory abilities.

26dd4930-eadb-4268-9b08-f537d4ff2994,Using Salt to Optimize Mental & Physical Performance,"I discuss the role of salt (sodium) in the nervous system and the key role that it plays in mental performance, physical performance and health. I explain how the brain senses salt levels in our body and how that relates to our feelings of thirst. I cover the physiology of the renal system and the hormones that control sodium and water balance in our body. I also explore how salt interacts with stress and our immune systems and its crucial role in neuron function. Additionally, I examine research findings suggesting that some individuals might benefit from increased intake of sodium and other electrolytes (magnesium and potassium) to enhance mental performance, lessen anxiety, and offset dizziness. Yet, other people may need less sodium. I discuss how you can determine your optimal sodium intake and why sodium intake levels need to be uniquely tailored to an individual’s lifestyle. Finally, I explain how salt creates ‘hidden’ sugars in many processed foods and the problems that can create. Throughout the episode, I explain peer-reviewed findings outlining salt’s essential role in overall health and describe general recommendations and tools anyone can use to find their optimal salt balance and thereby enhance their brain and body’s performance.",https://hubermanlab.com/using-salt-to-optimize-mental-and-physical-performance/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=138s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=177s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=657s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=906s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=1033s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=1455s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=1767s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=2027s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=2348s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=2746s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=3405s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=3739s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=4442s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=4633s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=5060s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=5277s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=5548s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=5794s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=6433s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=6793s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=6936s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ&t=7258s,"00:00:00 Role of Salt; 00:02:18 The Brain-Body Contract; 00:02:57 Neuropod Cells, Artificial Sweeteners & ‘Hidden’ Cravings; 00:10:57 AG1 (Athletic Greens), LMNT, InsideTracker; 00:15:06 Salt Regulation; 00:17:13 How the Brain Senses Salt; 00:24:15 Salt & Thirst; 00:29:27 Blood Pressure & Thirst; 00:33:47 Kidneys & Urine Regulation; 00:39:08Vasopressin: Roles in Libido & Urination; 00:45:46 How Much Salt Do You Need?; 00:56:45 Should You Increase Your Salt Intake?; 01:02:19 Tools: Determining Your Individual Salt Intake; 01:14:02 Iodine, Sea Salt; 01:17:13 Salt: Roles in Stress & Anxiety; 01:24:20 Other Electrolytes: Magnesium & Potassium; 01:27:57 Tools: Effects of Low-carbohydrate Diets & Caffeine; 01:32:28 General Recommendations for Salt Intake; 01:36:34 Perception of Salt & Sugar Taste, Processed Foods; 01:47:13 Role of Sodium in Neuronal Function, Action Potentials; 01:53:13 Dehydration; 01:55:36 What Salt Intake is Best for You?; 02:00:58 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify, Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Patreon, Thorne, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter",azb3Ih68awQ,1021,"['Optimize Mental & Physical Performance', 'Optimize Mental']","['I', 'the role', 'salt', 'sodium', 'the nervous system', 'the key role', 'that', 'it', 'mental performance', 'physical performance', 'health', 'I', 'the brain', 'salt levels', 'our body', 'that', 'our feelings', 'thirst', 'I', 'the physiology', 'the renal system', 'the hormones', 'that', 'sodium and water balance', 'our body', 'I', 'salt', 'stress', 'our immune systems', 'its crucial role', 'neuron function', 'I', 'research findings', 'some individuals', 'increased intake', 'sodium', 'other electrolytes', 'magnesium', 'potassium', 'mental performance', 'lessen anxiety', 'dizziness', 'other people', 'less sodium', 'I', 'you', 'your optimal sodium intake', 'sodium intake levels', 'an individual’s lifestyle', 'I', 'salt', '‘hidden’ sugars', 'many processed foods', 'the problems', 'that', 'the episode', 'I', 'peer-reviewed findings', 'salt’s essential role', 'overall health', 'general recommendations', 'tools', 'anyone', 'their optimal salt balance', 'their brain', 'body', 'performance', 'control sodium', 'water balance', 'examine research findings', 'offset dizziness', 'sodium intake', 'intake levels', '’ s lifestyle', '’ sugars', 'processed foods', 'findings outlining salt ’', 'tools anyone', 'salt balance']","1,546,215"

Dr. Sonnenburg’s research focuses on how microbes in our gut impact our mental and physical health and how diet and your environment shape your gut microbiome. We discuss the architecture of the gut microbiome and microbiota variability in different regions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and how these can change in response to diet, environment or genetics. We explore the early establishment of your microbiome and how your mode of delivery into the world (C-section or not) shapes your gut. We also discuss lifestyle factors that can alter your microbiome and the integral role the gut microbiome plays in communicating to other organs, including your brain. Dr. Sonnenburg details his recent clinical study, which found that diets rich in fermented foods (but not fiber) increase microbiota diversity and reduce signals of inflammation. Additionally, we examine how foods typical in Western Diets (e.g., high fat, low fiber, processed foods) can negatively impact the gut microbiome. Throughout the episode, we discuss actionable tools from peer-reviewed clinical findings that anyone can implement, regardless of budget, in order to optimize their gut microbiome and health.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-justin-sonnenburg-how-to-build-maintain-and-repair-gut-health/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=175s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=256s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=510s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=769s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=960s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=1316s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=1590s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=1738s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=2110s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=2524s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=3079s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=3684s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=4023s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=4364s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=4490s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=4817s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=5533s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=6093s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=6300s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=6442s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=6615s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=7005s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=7170s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=7460s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=7620s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20&t=7872s,"00:00:00 Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, Gut Microbiome; 00:02:55 The Brain Body Contract; 00:04:16 AG1 (Athletic Greens), ROKA, Helix Sleep; 00:08:30 What is the Gut Microbiome?; 00:12:49 Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract & Microbiota Variability; 00:16:00 Breast Feeding, C-Sections & Pets; 00:21:56 The Human Microbiome Project at Stanford; 00:26:30 Traditional vs. Industrialized Populations; 00:28:58 Resilience of the Microbiome; 00:35:10 Regional Differences Along Your GI Tract; 00:42:04 Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health; 00:51:19 Dietary Differences; 01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods; 01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners; 01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful?

Dr. Crum is a world expert on mindsets and beliefs and how they shape our responses to stress, exercise, and even to the foods we eat. Dr. Huberman and Dr. Crum discuss how our mindset about the nutritional content of food changes whether it is satisfying to us at a physiological (hormonal and metabolic) level. She also explains how mindsets about exercise can dramatically alter the effects of exercise on weight loss, blood pressure, and other health metrics. Dr. Crum teaches us how to think about stress in ways that allow stress to grow us and bring out our best rather than diminish our health and performance.

He explains the neural (brain) circuits that underlie goal setting and pursuit. Then he describes nine science-supported tools anyone can apply toward their goals. Dr. Huberman explains when and how to use goal visualization, when to use multitasking and how to use specific rewards to improve the likelihood of reaching your goals. He also explains why envisioning failures and their consequences are effective and how to set goals of the appropriate level of challenge. Dr. Huberman also explains how the molecule dopamine is used to gauge our progress toward milestones and long-term overarching goals and how to leverage dopamine for goal pursuit. Finally, he explains a unique tool called ‘space-time bridging’ that can be used to support all aspects of goal setting, assessment, and pursuit.

They discuss how and why humans breathe the way we do, the function of the diaphragm and how it serves to increase oxygenation of the brain and body. They also discuss how breathing influences mental state, fear, memory, reaction time, and more. And Dr. Huberman and Dr. Feldman discuss specific breathing protocols such as box-breathing, cyclic hyperventilation (similar to Wim Hof breathing), nasal versus mouth breathing, unilateral breathing, and how these each affect the brain and body. They discuss physiological sighs, peptides expressed by specific neurons controlling breathing, and magnesium compounds that can improve cognitive ability and how they work. This conversation serves as a sort of “masterclass” on the science of breathing and breathing-related tools for health and performance.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-jack-feldman-breathing-for-mental-physical-health-and-performance/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=185s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=635s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=875s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=980s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=1098s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=1211s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=1580s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=2020s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=2183s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=2979s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=3642s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=3934s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=4260s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=4585s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=4740s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=5380s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=5722s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=5888s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=5990s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=6041s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=6290s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=7033s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=7325s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=7589s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=8307s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&t=8453s,"00:00:00 Introducing Dr. Jack Feldman; 00:03:05 Sponsors: Thesis, Athletic Greens, Headspace, Our Breath Collective; 00:10:35 Why We Breathe; 00:14:35 Neural Control of Breathing: “Pre-Botzinger Complex”; 00:16:20 Nose vs Mouth Breathing; 00:18:18 Skeletal vs. Smooth Muscles: Diaphragm, Intracostals & Airway Muscles; 00:20:11 Two Breathing Oscillators: Pre-Botzinger Complex & Parafacial Nucleus; 00:26:20 How We Breathe Is Special (Compared to Non-Mammals); 00:33:40 Stomach & Chest Movements During Breathing; 00:36:23 Physiological Sighs, Alveoli Re-Filling, Bombesin; 00:49:39 If We Don’t Sigh, Our Lung (& General) Health Suffers; 01:00:42 Breathing, Brain States & Emotions; 01:05:34 Meditating Mice, Eliminating Fear; 01:11:00 Brain States, Amygdala, Locked-In Syndrome, Laughing; 01:16:25 Facial Expressions; 01:19:00 Locus Coeruleus & Alertness; 01:29:40 Breath Holds, Apnea, Episodic Hypoxia, Hypercapnia; 01:35:22 Stroke, Muscle Strength, TBI; 01:38:08 Cyclic Hyperventilation; 01:39:50 Hyperbaric Chambers; 01:40:41 Nasal Breathing, Memory, Right vs. Left Nostril; 01:44:50 Breathing Coordinates Everything: Reaction Time, Fear, etc.; 01:57:13 Dr. Feldman’s Breathwork Protocols, Post-Lunch; 02:02:05 Deliberately Variable Breathwork: The Feldman Protocol; 02:06:29 Magnesium Threonate & Cognition & Memory; 02:18:27 Gratitude for Dr. Feldman’s Highly Impactful Work; 02:20:53 Zero-Cost Support, Sponsors, Patreon, Instagram, Twitter, Thorne",GLgKkG44MGo,796,"['Breathing', 'Mental', 'Physical', 'Health', 'Performance', 'Physical Health']","['this episode', 'Distinguished Professor', 'Neurobiology', 'the University', 'California', 'Los Angeles', 'a pioneering world expert', 'the science', 'respiration', '(breathing', 'They', 'humans', 'the way', 'we', 'the function', 'the diaphragm', 'it', 'oxygenation', 'the brain', 'body', 'They', 'how breathing influences', 'mental state', 'fear', 'memory', 'reaction time', 'specific breathing protocols', 'box-breathing', 'cyclic hyperventilation', 'mouth breathing', 'unilateral breathing', 'these each', 'the brain', 'body', 'They', 'physiological sighs', 'peptides', 'specific neurons', 'breathing', 'magnesium compounds', 'that', 'cognitive ability', 'they', 'This conversation', 'a sort', '“masterclass', 'the science', 'breathing and breathing-related tools', 'health', 'performance', 'Distinguished Professor', 'Los Angeles', 'world expert', 'increase oxygenation', 'reaction time', 'breathing protocols', 'mouth breathing', 'neurons controlling breathing', 'magnesium compounds', 'masterclass ”']","680,112"
a6221fa2-b7b2-4609-9b3c-37da96971271,The Science of Making & Breaking Habits,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman reviews the science of habit formation and habit elimination and how the process of neuroplasticity (brain rewiring) underlies these processes. He describes two new systems for habit formation. The first system is grounded in the neuroscience of brain states and our ability to perform (and to avoid) certain tasks at different phases of the 24-hour day. The second system focuses on 21-day habit formation and consolidation. He also discusses “task bracketing” as an approach to enhancing habit formation and eliminating unwanted habits and the neural circuits that underlie task bracketing in the basal ganglia (a brain region for generating and stopping behaviors). Dr. Huberman also reviews the science of dopamine rewards and how to apply that knowledge to shaping habits. The science and tools in this episode ought to be helpful for anyone looking to build better habits and eliminate unwanted habits for school, work, fitness, relationships, creative endeavors, and more—indeed for any person or situation where behavioral changes are needed.",https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-making-and-breaking-habits/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=150s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=412s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=531s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=700s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=967s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=1135s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=1375s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=1443s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=1668s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=1860s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=2228s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=2296s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=2789s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=3324s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=3694s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=3897s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=4230s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=4702s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=5306s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=5749s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=5870s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=6266s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=6328s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g&t=6507s,"00:00:00 Introducing Habits; New Programs; 00:02:30 Athletic Greens, InsideTracker, Helix Sleep; 00:06:52 Habits versus Reflexes, Learning, Neuroplasticity; 00:08:51 Goal-Based Habits vs. Identity-Based Habits; 00:11:40 How Long It (Really) Takes to Form a Habit; Limbic-Friction; 00:16:07 Linchpin Habits; 00:18:55 Mapping Your Habits; Habit Strength, Context-Dependence; 00:22:55 Automaticity; 00:24:03 Tool 1: Applying Procedural Memory Visualizations; 00:27:48 Hebbian Learning, NMDA receptors; 00:31:00 Tool 2: Task Bracketing; Dorsolateral Striatum; 00:37:08 States of Mind, Not Scheduling Time Predicts Habit Strength; 00:38:16 Tool 3: Phase-Based Habit Plan: Phase 1; 00:46:29 Tool 3: Phase-Based Habit Plan: Phase 2; 00:55:24 Tool 3: Phase-Based Habit Plan: Phase 3; 01:01:34 Habit Flexibility; 01:04:57 Should We Reward Ourselves?

5ef7d451-2da1-4a0f-bb0c-c5642489ea46,"Science of Social Bonding in Family, Friendship & Romantic Love","In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses the science of social bonding- the process by which we form attachments. He explains the neural and hormonal basis for “social homeostasis” (our drive for a given amount of socializing), which reveals why we get lonely, why we seek out connection with others and how power dynamics (hierarchies) shape those connections. Dr. Huberman also discusses the neurochemical basis of introversion and extroversion, of trust and how shared experiences that promote similar physiological states in two or more individuals lead to more rapid bonding. He also discusses how food and oxytocin play key roles in social bonding.

Dr. Berson discovered the neurons in your eye that set your biological rhythms for sleep, wakefulness, mood and appetite. He is also a world-renowned teacher of basic and advanced neuroscience, having taught thousands of university lectures on this topic. Many of his students have become world-leading neuroscientists and teachers themselves. Here Dr. Berson takes us on a structured journey into and around the nervous system, explaining: how we perceive the world and our internal landscape, how we balance, see, and remember. Also, how we learn and perform reflexive and deliberate actions, how we visualize and imagine in our mind, and how the various circuits of the brain coordinate all these incredible feats. Dr. Huberman and Dr. Berson discuss practical and real-life examples of neural circuit function across the lifespan. Dr. Berson gives us a masterclass in the nervous system—one that, in just less than two hours, will teach you an entire course’s worth about the brain and how yours works.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-david-berson-your-brains-logic-and-function/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=175s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=482s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=602s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=827s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=1016s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=1545s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=2085s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=2180s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=2463s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=3043s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=3603s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=3755s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=4244s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=4404s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=4595s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=5080s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=5613s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=5787s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=6320s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=6544s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3fhUjg30E&t=6620s,"00:00:00 Dr. David Berson; 00:02:55 Sponsors: Athletic Greens, InsideTracker, Magic Spoon; 00:08:02 How We See; 00:10:02 Color Vision; 00:13:47 “Strange” Vision; 00:16:56 How You Orient In Time; 00:25:45 Body Rhythms, Pineal function, Light & Melatonin, Blueblockers; 00:34:45 Spending Times Outdoors Improves Eyesight; 00:36:20 Sensation, Mood, & Self-Image; 00:41:03 Sense of Balance; 00:50:43 Why Pigeons Bob Their Heads, Motion Sickness; 01:00:03 Popping Ears; 01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight; 01:10:44 Why Tilted Motion Feels Good; 01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions; 01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & the “2 Marshmallow Test”; 01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex; 01:33:33 Neuroplasticity; 01:36:27 What is a Connectome?; 01:45:20 How to Learn (More About the Brain); 01:49:04 Book Suggestion, my Berson Appreciation; 01:50:20 Zero-Cost ways to Support the HLP, Guest Suggestions, Sponsors, Patreon, Thorne",oC3fhUjg30E,407,"['Your Brain’s Logic', 'Function', 'Brain ’ s Logic']","['this episode', 'Professor', 'Chairman', 'Neuroscience', 'Brown University', 'the neurons', 'your eye', 'that', 'your biological rhythms', 'sleep', 'mood', 'appetite', 'He', 'a world-renowned teacher', 'basic and advanced neuroscience', 'thousands', 'university lectures', 'this topic', 'his students', 'world-leading neuroscientists', 'teachers', 'themselves', 'us', 'a structured journey', 'the nervous system', 'we', 'the world', 'our internal landscape', 'we', 'we', 'reflexive and deliberate actions', 'we', 'our mind', 'how the various circuits', 'the brain coordinate', 'all these incredible feats', 'practical and real-life examples', 'neural circuit function', 'the lifespan', 'us', 'a masterclass', 'the nervous system', 'one', 'that', 'just less than two hours', 'you', 'an entire course', 'the brain', 'yours', 'Brown University', 'university lectures', 'circuit function']","215,967"
4b21e9ee-6757-451c-84e2-26bf643bce0a,Erasing Fears & Traumas Based on the Modern Neuroscience of Fear,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses fear and trauma, including the neural circuits involved in the “threat reflex” and how specific experiences and memories activate that system. He also discusses how our body is involved in trauma and fear. First, Dr. Huberman describes the logic of fear mechanisms and how “top-down” processing–meaning connections from the parts of the brain that assign meaning to our feelings, are involved in fear and erasing fears and traumas. Then he discusses what successful fear and trauma treatment must include and considers various treatments for whether they meet that standard, such as EMDR, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Ketamine, other drug-assisted therapies, and more. Dr. Huberman also reviews new data on how 5 minutes per day of deliberate, self-imposed stress can erase fear and depression. And he reviews the role that social connection plays in erasing or maintaining fears by activating specific molecular pathways in the brain and body. Finally, he reviews supplementation with over-the-counter compounds for their effects on anxiety and fear and when to take them, if at all.",https://hubermanlab.com/erasing-fears-and-traumas-based-on-the-modern-neuroscience-of-fear/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=135s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=409s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=705s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=824s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=1056s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=1704s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=1947s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=2158s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=2505s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=2770s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=3025s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=3476s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=3928s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=4440s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=4703s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=5100s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=5965s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=6376s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=6590s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=7182s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=7350s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=7800s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y&t=7906s,"00:00:00 Introducing Fear, Trauma & Trauma; 00:02:15 Athletic Greens, InsideTracker, Helix Sleep; 00:06:49 What is Fear?; 00:11:45 Autonomic Arousal: “Alertness” vs. “Calmness”; 00:13:44 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis (HPA axis); 00:17:36 “The Threat Reflex”: Neural Circuits for Fear; 00:28:24 Controlling Fear: Top-Down Processing; 00:32:27 Narratives: “Protective or Dangerous”; 00:35:58 Attaching Fear to Events: Classical Conditioning & Memory; 00:41:45 How Fear Learning Occurs: Long Term Potentiation, NMDA; 00:46:10 Extinguishing (Reducing) Fears; 00:50:25 Cognitive (Narrative) Therapies for Fear; 00:57:56 Repetition of Narrative, Overwriting Bad Experiences with Good; 01:05:28 EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing; 01:14:00 Social Connection & Isolation Are Chemically Powerful; 01:18:23 Trans-Generational Trauma; 01:25:00 PTSD Treatments: Ketamine, MDMA, oxytocin; 01:39:25 How Do You Know If You Are Traumatized?; 01:46:16 Deliberate Brief Stress Can Erase Fears & Trauma; 01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas In 5 Minutes Per Day; 01:59:42 Nutrition, Sleep, & Other General Support Erasing Fear & Trauma; 02:02:30 Supplements for Anxiety, Fear: Saffron, Inositol, Kava; 02:10:00 Synthesis; 02:11:46 Zero-Cost Support, Sponsors, Patreon, Supplements, Instagram, Twitter",31wjVhCcI5Y,1073,"['Erasing Fears', 'the Modern Neuroscience', 'Fear', 'Erasing Fears', 'Modern Neuroscience']","['this episode', 'fear', 'trauma', 'the neural circuits', 'the “threat reflex', 'how specific experiences', 'memories', 'that system', 'He', 'our body', 'trauma', 'fear', 'the logic', 'fear mechanisms', 'how “top-down” processing', 'connections', 'the parts', 'the brain', 'that', 'meaning', 'our feelings', 'fear', 'fears', 'traumas', 'he', 'what', 'trauma treatment', 'various treatments', 'they', 'that standard', 'EMDR', 'Cognitive Behavioral Therapy', 'other drug-assisted therapies', 'new data', 'how 5 minutes', 'day', 'deliberate, self-imposed stress', 'fear', 'depression', 'he', 'the role', 'that', 'social connection', 'fears', 'specific molecular pathways', 'the brain', 'body', 'he', 'supplementation', 'the-counter', 'their effects', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'them', '“ threat', 'fear mechanisms', '” processing–meaning connections', 'erasing fears', 'trauma treatment', 'Cognitive Behavioral Therapy', 'connection plays', 'maintaining fears', 'reviews supplementation']","1,266,367"

Dr. Buss describes his work on how people select mates for short and long-term relationships, the dynamics of human courtship, and mate value assessment — meaning how people measure up as potential partners. Dr. Huberman and Dr. Buss also discuss the causes of infidelity and differences for infidelity in men and women. Dr. Buss explains how people evaluate and try to alter other people’s mate value as a means to secure and even poach mates. Dr. Huberman and Dr. Buss discuss monogamous and non-monogamous relationships in humans. And they discuss what Dr. Buss calls “the dark triad”— features common in stalkers and narcissists that relate to sexual and psychological violence in relationships. This episode is sure to be of interest to anyone single or in a relationship who seeks to know how people select mates and anyone who is interested in forming and maintaining healthy romantic partnerships.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-david-buss-how-humans-select-and-keep-romantic-partners-in-short-and-long-term/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=250s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=513s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=820s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=1111s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=1510s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=1940s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=2250s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=2320s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=2516s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=2785s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=3265s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=3420s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=3555s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=3875s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=3982s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=4210s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=5053s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=5112s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=5253s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=5605s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=5955s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=6204s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=6400s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=6840s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=7332s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=7535s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=7616s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc&t=7842s,"00:00:00 Introducing Dr. David Buss; 00:04:10 Sponsors: ROKA, InsideTracker, Headspace; 00:08:33 Choosing a Mate; 00:13:40 Long Term Mates: Universal Desires; 00:18:31 What Women & Men Seek in Long-Term Mates; 00:25:10 Age Differences & Mating History; 00:32:20 Deception in Courtship; 00:37:30 Emotional Stability; 00:38:40 Lying About Long-Term Interest; 00:41:56 Short-Term Mating Criteria, Sliding Standards & Context Effects; 00:46:25 Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching; 00:54:25 Genetic Cuckholds, How Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference; 00:57:00 Long-Term vs Short-Term Cheating, Concealment; 00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity; 01:04:35 Contraception; 01:06:22 Status & Mating Success; 01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence; 01:24:13 Specificity of Intimate Partner Violence; 01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.; 01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy; 01:33:25 Stalking; 01:39:15 Influence of Children on Mate Value Assessments; 01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity; 01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships; 01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety About the Truth; 02:02:12 Self Deception; 02:05:35 The Future of Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience; 02:06:56 Books: When Men Behave Badly; The Evolution of Desire, Textbooks; 02:10:42 Concluding Statements, Zero-Cost Support: Subscribe, Sponsors, Patreon, Thorne",HXzTbCEqCJc,1063,"['Keep', 'Romantic Partners', 'Short', 'Long', 'Term', 'Humans Select']","['this episode', 'Professor', 'Psychology', 'the University', 'Texas', 'the founding members', 'the field', 'evolutionary psychology', 'his work', 'people', 'mates', 'short and long-term relationships', 'the dynamics', 'human courtship', 'mate value assessment', 'people', 'potential partners', 'the causes', 'infidelity', 'differences', 'infidelity', 'men', 'women', 'people', 'other people’s mate value', 'a means', 'mates', 'monogamous and non-monogamous relationships', 'humans', 'they', 'what', 'stalkers', 'narcissists', 'that', 'sexual and psychological violence', 'relationships', 'This episode', 'interest', 'anyone', 'a relationship', 'who', 'people', 'mates', 'anyone', 'who', 'healthy romantic partnerships', 'founding members', 'people select mates', 'mate value assessment — meaning', 'poach mates', 'triad ” — features']","709,601"
b804bf0b-cd86-4cea-a96c-069f2ed0cc63,The Science of Gratitude & How to Build a Gratitude Practice,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses the science of gratitude, shown in peer-reviewed studies, to have tremendous positive effects on mental and physical health. He explains, however, that most commonly used gratitude practices are ineffective (such as gratitude lists). The key elements of highly effective gratitude practices are described, including the essential need for story (narrative), receiving or perceiving gratitude rather than giving it, and the role that theory of mind plays in this context. Dr. Huberman also discusses why we can’t simply make up feelings of gratitude and how reluctance undermines the process. He also explains the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie the reductions in fear and increases in motivation and lowering of inflammatory chemicals that effective narrative-based gratitude can trigger. Throughout the episode, he uses the science of gratitude to design a brief but highly effective protocol.",https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-gratitude-and-how-to-build-a-gratitude-practice/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=110s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=273s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=551s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=740s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=1070s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=1282s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=1510s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=1810s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=2095s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=2550s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=2750s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=3148s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=3375s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=3595s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=3780s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=3944s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=4055s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=4256s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=4560s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=4730s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVjfFN89qvQ&t=5065s,"00:00:00 Introduction: Gratitude Science & Surprises; 00:01:50 Controlling Heart Rate with Story; 00:04:33 Sponsors: ROKA, InsideTracker, Magic Spoon; 00:09:11 Major, Long-Lasting Benefits of Gratitude Practice; 00:12:20 Prosocial vs. Defensive Thinking, Behaviors, & Neural Circuits; 00:17:50 Why We All Need an Effective Gratitude Practice; 00:21:22 Neurochemistry & Neural Circuits of Gratitude; 00:25:10 Prefrontal Cortex Set Context; 00:30:10 Ineffective Gratitude Practices; Autonomic Variables; 00:34:55 Key Features of Effective Gratitude Practices: Receiving Thanks & Story; 00:42:30 Theory of Mind Is Key; 00:45:50 Building Effective Gratitude Practices: Adopting Narratives, Duration; 00:52:28 Narratives That Shift Brain-Body Circuits; 00:56:15 You Can’t Lie About Liking Something; Reluctance In Giving; 00:59:55 How Gratitude Changes Your Brain: Reduces Anxiety, Increases Motivation; 01:03:00 5 Minutes (Is More Than Enough), 3X Weekly, Timing Each Day; 01:05:44 Empathy & Anterior Cingulate Cortex; 01:07:35 Reducing Inflammation & Fear with Gratitude; 01:10:56 Serotonin, Kanna/Zembrin; 01:16:00 Neuroplasticity, Pharmacology, Brain Machine Interfaces; 01:18:50 The Best Gratitude Practices: & How To, My Protocol; 01:24:25 Subscribe & Feedback, Supporting Sponsors, Supplements (Thorne)",KVjfFN89qvQ,1071,"['The Science', 'Gratitude', 'a Gratitude Practice']","['this episode', 'the science', 'gratitude', 'peer-reviewed studies', 'tremendous positive effects', 'mental and physical health', 'He', 'most commonly used gratitude practices', 'gratitude lists', 'The key elements', 'highly effective gratitude practices', 'the essential need', 'story', 'narrative', 'gratitude', 'it', 'the role', 'that', 'theory', 'mind', 'this context', 'we', 'feelings', 'gratitude', 'reluctance', 'the process', 'He', 'the neural circuit mechanisms', 'that', 'the reductions', 'fear', 'increases', 'motivation', 'lowering', 'inflammatory chemicals', 'effective narrative-based gratitude', 'the episode', 'he', 'the science', 'gratitude', 'a brief but highly effective protocol', 'used gratitude practices', 'gratitude lists', 'gratitude practices', 'perceiving gratitude', 'mind plays', 'circuit mechanisms']","801,329"
488b9e37-93f5-45bf-9a49-c9fd463aba1d,"Time Perception & Entrainment by Dopamine, Serotonin & Hormones","In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses how our brain and body track time and the role that neurochemicals, in particular dopamine and serotonin, but also hormones such as melatonin, allow us to orient ourselves in time. He reviews the three types of time perception: of the past, of the present, and the future, and how dopamine and serotonin adjust both our perception of the speed of the passage of time and our memory of how long previous experiences lasted. Dr. Huberman also discusses circannual entrainment, which is the process by which our brain and body are matched to the seasons, and circadian (24 hours) entrainment, both of which subconsciously adjust our perceived measurement of time. He explains the mechanisms of that subconscious control. And he covers the ultradian (90 minutes) rhythms that govern our ability to focus, including how to track when these 90-minute rhythms begin and end for the sake of work and productivity. Dr. Huberman includes ten tools based on the science of time perception that you can apply to enhance productivity, creativity, and relationships in various contexts.",https://hubermanlab.com/time-perception-and-entrainment-by-dopamine-serotonin-and-hormones/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=312s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=565s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=800s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=966s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=1273s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=1380s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=1500s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=1902s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=2080s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=2238s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=2350s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=2558s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=2618s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=2678s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=3004s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=3063s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=3218s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=3390s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=3654s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=3780s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=4060s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=4318s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWDAqodDas&t=4347s,"00:00:00 Introducing Time Perception, Note on Fasting & Supplements; 00:05:12 Sponsors: ROKA, Athletic Greens, InsideTracker; 00:09:25 Entrainment, Circannual Entrainment, Melatonin; 00:13:20 Seasonal Oscillations in Testosterone & Estrogen, Tool 1; 00:16:06 Circadian Timing, Tools 1, 2, 3 (for Circadian Entrainment); 00:21:13 Tool 4: Timing Physical Activity; Tool 5: Timing Eating Window; 00:23:00 When Circadian Entrainment is Disrupted, Time Perception Suffers; 00:25:00 Tool 6: Ultradian (90min) Cycles & Focus; 00:31:42 Our Sense of the Passage of Time: Present, Prospective, Retrospective; 00:34:40 Dopamine (& Nor/epinephrine) Lead to Time Overestimation; Frame Rate; 00:37:18 Serotonin & Time Underestimation; Decreased Frame Rate; 00:39:10 Dopamine vs. Serotonin Across the Day; Tool 7: When to Do Rigid vs. Creative Work; 00:42:38 Example of Tool 7; 00:43:38 How Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance; 00:44:38 Trauma, “Over-clocking” & Memories; Adjusting Rates of Experience; 00:50:04 Why Trauma Involves Dopamine & Epinephrine, Arousal; 00:51:03 Dopamine, Spontaneous Blinking & Time Perception; Tool 8; 00:53:38 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate in Discomfort; 00:56:30 Fun “Feels Fast” BUT Is Remembered as Slow; Boring Stuff “Feels Slow,” Recall As Fast; 01:00:54 Retrospective Time, Context Variation & Enhanced Bonding with Places & People; 01:03:00 Dopamine Release Resets the Start of Each Time Bin on Our Experience; 01:07:40 Habits & Time Perception; Tool 10 (Setting Functional Units of Each Day); 01:11:58 Synthesis & Book Suggestion (Your Brain Is a Time Machine by D.

a9b8deff-ebaa-45fd-a055-fc56dd83a851,Using Your Nervous System to Enhance Your Immune System,"This episode teaches you a lot about the immune system, immune-brain interactions and offers 12 potential tools for enhancing immune system function. Dr. Huberman discusses how our immune system works and science-supported tools we can use to enhance our immune system. He discusses the innate and adaptive immune systems and our various microbiomes—not just in our gut but also in our nose, eyes and mouth and how to keep them healthy. And he reviews how specific patterns of breathing and foods maintain a healthy mucosal barrier that is crucial for fighting infections. Dr. Huberman discusses how certain neurochemicals called catecholamines enhance our immune system function and how to use specific breathing protocols, types and timing of heat and cold exposure, and if appropriate, supplementation to activate catecholamines. He also discusses the role and use of serotonin for the sake of accessing the specific types of sleep for recovering from illness, and he discusses how to increase glymphatic “washout” of brain debris during sleep. Dr. Huberman also reviews fever, the vagus nerve and the use of atypical yet highly effective compounds for rhinitis (nasal inflammation).",https://hubermanlab.com/using-your-nervous-system-to-enhance-your-immune-system/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=180s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=461s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=680s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=1028s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=1266s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=1680s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=1833s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=2060s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=2096s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=2348s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=2520s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=2620s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=2805s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=3183s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=3304s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=4023s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=4253s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=4356s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=5350s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=5530s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=5820s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=6125s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=6369s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=6562s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=6820s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poOf8b2WE2g&t=7080s,"00:00:00 The Mind & Immune System, New Findings: Acupuncture & Fascia; 00:03:00 Sponsors: ROKA, Athletic Greens, InsideTracker; 00:07:41 Foundational Tools & Practices for of a Healthy Immune System; 00:11:20 Immune System Basics: Skin/Mucous, Innate & Adaptive Immune System; 00:17:08 Killer Cells, Complement Proteins (“Eat Me!” Signals), Cytokines (“Help Me!” Signals); 00:21:06 The Adaptive Immune System: Antibodies; 00:28:00 Tool 1: Nasal Microbiome and “Scrubbing” Bacteria & Viruses; Nasal Breathing; 00:30:33 Tools 2 & 3: (Not) Touching Your Eyes; Gut Microbiome & Fermented Foods; 00:34:20 Some Interleukins Are Anti-Inflammatory; 00:34:56 Sickness Behavior; 00:39:08 Some People Seek Care When Sick, Others Want to be Alone; 00:42:00 Sickness Behavior & Depression: Cytokines; 00:43:40 Reduced Appetites When Sick: Protein, Iron, Libido; 00:46:45 Vagus-Nerve Stimulation: Fever, Photophobia, Sleepiness; 00:53:03 Humoral (Blood-Borne) Factors, & Choroid Change Your Brain State; 00:55:04 Tools 4, 5: Reducing Sickness: Glymphatic Clearance, Pre-Sleep Serotonin, 5HTP; 01:07:03 Tool 6: Hot Showers, Saunas, Baths & Cortisol, Heath-Cold Contrast; 01:10:53 Feed a Fever & Starve a Cold (?), Adrenaline; 01:12:36 Tool 7: Activating Your Immune System w/Cyclic-Hyperventilation, Alkalinity; 01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine; 01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, You Can Worry Yourself Sick; 01:37:00 Tool 8: Healthy Mindsets, Hope, Dopamine; Tool 9: Tyrosine; Tool 10: Cold Exposure; 01:42:05 Once You’re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis; 01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells; 01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism for How It Reduces Inflammation; Fascia, Rolfing; 01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices; 01:58:00 Synthesis, Ways to Support Us (Zero-Cost), Sponsors, Supplements, Social Media",poOf8b2WE2g,923,"['Your Nervous System', 'Your Immune System']","['This episode', 'you', 'a lot', 'the immune system', 'immune-brain interactions', '12 potential tools', 'immune system function', 'our immune system', 'we', 'our immune system', 'He', 'the innate and adaptive immune systems', 'our various microbiomes', 'our gut', 'our nose', 'eyes', 'mouth', 'them', 'he', 'how specific patterns', 'breathing', 'foods', 'a healthy mucosal barrier', 'that', 'infections', 'certain neurochemicals', 'catecholamines', 'our immune system function', 'specific breathing protocols', 'types', 'timing', 'heat and cold exposure', 'catecholamines', 'He', 'the role', 'use', 'serotonin', 'the sake', 'the specific types', 'sleep', 'illness', 'he', 'glymphatic “washout', 'brain debris', 'sleep', 'fever', 'the vagus nerve', 'the use', 'atypical yet highly effective compounds', 'rhinitis (nasal inflammation', 'immune system', 'system function', 'immune system immune system', 'immune systems', 'mucosal barrier', 'fighting infections', 'immune system function', 'breathing protocols', 'activate catecholamines', 'brain debris', 'vagus nerve']","544,186"

Dr. Hattar is a world-renowned expert on how viewing light at particular times adjusts our mood, ability to learn, stress and hormone levels, appetite, and mental health. They discuss how to determine and use your individual light sensitivity to determine the optimal sleep-wake cycle for you. They also discuss how to combine your light viewing and waking time with the timing of your food intake and exercise in order to maximize mental and physical functioning. Dr. Hattar is credited with co-discovering the neurons in the eye that set our circadian clocks and regulate mood and appetite. He explains why even a small shift in daylight savings leads to outsized effects on our biking because of the way that our cells and circadian clocks integrate across many days. And he offers precise tools to rapidly adjust to jetlag, shift work, and reset your clock after a late night of work or socializing. This episode is filled with cutting-edge data on the biological mechanisms of human physiology and practical tools for people of all ages.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-samer-hattar-timing-light-food-exercise-for-better-sleep-energy-mood/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=137s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=375s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=870s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=1135s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=1215s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=1820s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=2028s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=2313s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=2536s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=2695s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=2937s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=3238s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=3363s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=3665s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=3905s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=4039s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=4097s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=4688s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=4971s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=5415s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=5504s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=5620s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=5870s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=5973s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=6068s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=6168s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=6215s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=6644s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=6735s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=6850s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=6925s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=7148s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=7527s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=7768s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=7852s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUu3f0ETMJQ&t=7980s,"00:00:00 Introducing Dr. Samer Hattar, Ph.D.; 00:02:17 Sponsors: ROKA, InsideTracker, Magic Spoon; 00:06:15 Light, Circadian (24 hour) & Circannual (365 day) “Photoentrainment”; 00:14:30 Neurons in Our Eyes That Set Our Body Clocks: Similar to Frog Skin; 00:18:55 What Blind People See; 00:20:15 When, How & How Long to View Light for Optimal Sleep & Wakefulness; 00:30:20 Sunlight Simulators, Afternoon Light Viewing, Naps; 00:33:48 Are You Jetlagged at Home?

a7d5d595-468c-44ea-8900-df9dc3b13d02,Nutrients For Brain Health & Performance,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman describes science-supported nutrients for brain and performance (cognition) and general nervous system health. He describes ten tools for this purpose, including specific amounts and sources for Omega-3 fatty acids, which make up the “structural fat” of neurons (nerve cells) and allow them to function across our lifespan. He also reviews data on creatine, phosphatidylserine, anthocyanins, choline, glutamine and how they each impact brain function in healthy people seeking to reinforce and improve their cognition and in those combatting cognitive decline. Dr. Huberman describes both food-based and supplement-based sources for these compounds and their effective dose ranges based on peer-reviewed literature. Then he reviews the three factors: gut-brain signaling, perceived taste, and learned associations that combine with the metabolic and blood-sugar-elevating effects of food to determine what foods we seek and prefer. Amazingly, it’s not just about what tastes good to us. Next, Dr. Huberman explores how we can leverage the neural circuits of learned food preference toward seeking and enjoying the right foods for brain health and performance. He also reviews new data on non-caloric sweeteners and why consuming them with glucose-elevating foods can be detrimental, in some cases rapidly leading to insulin dysregulation. This episode covers more than ten actionable tools for those seeking to improve and/or maintain brain function. It explains modern neuroscience underlying our sense of taste, our food-seeking preferences, and brain metabolism.",https://hubermanlab.com/nutrients-for-brain-health-and-performance/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=128s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=259s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=504s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=562s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=780s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=1235s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=1335s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=1706s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=1790s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=1942s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=2188s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=2479s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=2963s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=3325s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=3590s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=3974s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=4036s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=4331s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=4405s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=4695s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=4937s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=5442s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=5765s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw&t=5908s,"00:00:00 Food & Brain Function Introduction; 00:02:08 Summary: Critical Aspects of Time Restricted Feeding/Fasting; 00:04:19 Sponsors: Roka, Athletic Greens, Headspace; 00:08:24 Neuroplasticity Super Protocol (Zero-Cost Tools) Online; 00:09:22 Eating to Enhance Brain Function & Foundational Aspects of Brain Health; 00:13:00 Eating Fats for Brain Health, EFAs Phospholipids (Tool 1: 1-3g EPA Omega-3/day); 00:20:35 Phosphatidylserine (Tool 2: 300mg/day); 00:22:15 Choline, Egg Yolks (Tool 3: 1-2g/day Threshold); 00:28:26 Hydration & Electrolytes (Tool 4); 00:29:50 Liquid Fish Oil/Capsules (2-3g EPA per day; 300mg Alpha GPC 2-4X/week); 00:32:22 Creatine for Cognition (Tool 5: 5g/day); 00:36:28 Anthocyanins, Dark Skin Berries (Tool 6-10mg/day (Extract), 1-2 cups Berries); 00:41:19 L-Glutamine (Tool: 1-10g/day) & Offsetting Apnea & Inflammation; 00:49:23 Neural Basis of Food Preference, Yum, Yuck, Meh; Taste, Guts, & Beliefs; 00:55:25 Taste is 100% In your Head; 00:59:50 Gut Neurons Controlling Food Preference: Neuropod Cells; (Tool 7: Fermented Foods); 01:06:14 Capsule Probiotics, Brain Fog; 01:07:16 Learning to Like Specific Tastes: Sweetness & Brain Metabolism; 01:12:11 Hard-Wiring & Soft-Wiring; 01:13:25 Artificial & Non-Caloric Sweeteners: Safe or Harmful Depends on (Glucose) Context; 01:18:15 Non-Caloric Sweetener & Insulin; (Tool 8: Don’t Have w/Glucose Elevating Foods); 01:22:17 Beliefs & Thoughts; The Insula; (Tool 9: Pairing-Based Reshaping Food Preferences); 01:30:42 Liking Neuro-Healthy Foods & Bettering Brain Metabolism (Tool 10); Food Wars; 01:36:05 Food Reward & Diabetes, Obesity; Important Review Article (See Caption); 01:38:28 Synthesis, Zero-Cost Support, Future Topic Suggestions, Sponsors, Supplements",E7W4OQfJWdw,1030,"['Nutrients', 'Brain Health', 'Performance', 'Brain Health']","['this episode', 'science-supported nutrients', 'brain', 'performance', 'cognition', 'general nervous system health', 'He', 'ten tools', 'this purpose', 'specific amounts', 'sources', 'Omega-3 fatty acids', 'which', 'the “structural fat', 'neurons', 'nerve cells', 'them', 'our lifespan', 'He', 'data', 'creatine', 'phosphatidylserine', 'anthocyanins', 'choline', 'glutamine', 'they', 'each', 'brain function', 'healthy people', 'their cognition', 'those', 'cognitive decline', 'both food-based and supplement-based sources', 'these compounds', 'their effective dose ranges', 'peer-reviewed literature', 'he', 'the three factors', 'gut-brain signaling', 'perceived taste', 'associations', 'that', 'the metabolic and blood-sugar-elevating effects', 'food', 'what foods', 'we', 'it', 'what', 'us', 'we', 'the neural circuits', 'learned food preference', 'the right foods', 'brain health', 'performance', 'He', 'new data', 'non-caloric sweeteners', 'them', 'glucose-elevating foods', 'some cases', 'insulin dysregulation', 'This episode', 'more than ten actionable tools', 'those', 'brain function', 'It', 'modern neuroscience', 'our sense', 'taste', 'our food-seeking preferences', 'brain metabolism', 'system health', 'nerve cells', 'reviews data', 'impact brain function', 'gut-brain signaling', 'perceived taste', 'learned associations', 'brain health', 'insulin dysregulation', 'improve and/or maintain brain function', 'brain metabolism']","1,118,039"
5613b996-f780-43ea-8d6f-0204d84c7340,Effects of Fasting & Time Restricted Eating on Fat Loss & Health,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses the science and practice of fasting, also called time-restricted feeding. He reviews the data on how limiting food intake to specific portions of every 24-hour cycle (or fasting longer) impacts weight loss, fat loss specifically, liver health, mental focus, muscle, longevity and more. Dr. Huberman explains how “fasted” is contextual and relates to blood glucose levels and their downstream effects, and how the depth of fasting can be adjusted with behaviors such as different types of exercise or with glucose disposal agents. He also discusses the optimal fasting protocol: and both the absolute (non-negotiable) and variable (contextual) features of a fasting/time-restricted-feeding protocol that will allow you to get the most benefits. He also discusses what does and does not break a fast, the effects of fasting on hormones like testosterone and cortisol, and fertility. Dr. Huberman also reviews how different feeding windows of 8 or 10 or 4 hours differentially impact the effects of fasting and why the classic 8 hour feeding window came to be but also might be ideal. He discusses mechanisms and offers tools to discern the optimal fasting duration and timing for you.",https://hubermanlab.com/effects-of-fasting-and-time-restricted-eating-on-fat-loss-and-health/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=362s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=582s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=680s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=830s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=1188s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=1533s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=1785s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=1886s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=2193s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=2385s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=2495s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=2738s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=3155s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=3340s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=3570s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=3788s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=4093s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=4400s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=4957s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=5260s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=5355s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=5520s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=5920s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=6110s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=6329s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=6435s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=6552s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=6795s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=7130s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=7302s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=7602s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=7700s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=7763s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=7872s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&t=8640s,"00:00:00 Introduction, Blood Glucose & Mortality, Mice Vs.

81024157-1905-492f-8031-2b2cd7072be6,"Dr. Craig Heller: Using Temperature for Performance, Brain & Body Health","In this episode, Dr. Huberman is joined by Dr. Craig Heller, Professor of Biology at Stanford University and a world expert on the science of temperature regulation. They discuss how the body and brain maintain temperature under different conditions and how almost everyone uses the wrong approach to cool off or heat up. Dr. Heller teaches us the best ways and, in doing so, explains how to offset hyperthermia and hypothermia. He also explains how we can use the precise timing and location of cooling on our body to greatly enhance endurance and weight training performance. He describes how cooling technology discovered and engineered in his laboratory has led to a tripling of anaerobic (weight training) performance and allowed endurance athletes to run further and faster and eliminate delayed onset muscle soreness.

He describes what it does and the neural circuits involved. He explains dopamine peaks and baselines and the cell biology of dopamine depletion. Dr. Huberman includes 14 tools for how to control your dopamine release for the sake of motivation, focus, avoiding and combating addiction and depression. He explains why dopamine stacking with chemicals and behaviors inevitably leads to states of underwhelm and poor performance. He explains how to achieve sustained increases in baseline dopamine, compounds that injure and protect dopamine neurons, including caffeine, from specific sources.

They discuss the biology and medical clinical-trial uses of psilocybin, MDMA, ayahuasca, DMT, and LSD. Dr. Johnson teaches us what the clinical trials in his lab reveal about the potential these compounds hold for the treatment of depression, addiction, trauma, eating disorders, ADHD, and other disorders of the mind. Dr. Johnson describes a typical psychedelic experiment in his laboratory, start to finish, including the conditions for optimal clinical outcomes. And he explains some of the potential hazards and common misconceptions and pitfalls related to psychedelic medicine. Dr. Johnson explains flashbacks, the heightened risks of certain people and age groups using psychedelics, and the evolving legal and pharmaceutical industry landscape surrounding psychedelics. Dr. Johnson also describes how the scientific study of psychedelics is likely to set the trajectory of psychiatric medicine in the years to come. Dr. Johnson is among a small handful of researchers who have pioneered the clinical study of these powerful compounds.

He discusses both behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for ADHD and brain-machine interface tools. Dr. Huberman also discusses behavioral training protocols that can improve focus in people with ADHD and those without ADHD and for people of different ages. He discusses the role of dopamine in coordinating ‘default-mode’ and ‘task-related’ neural networks, attentional “blinks” (lapses of attention) and how to overcome them, and the role of actual blinks in time perception and attention. Finally, Dr. Huberman reviews some of the prescription and over-the-counter compounds for increasing focus, such as Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil and Armodafinil, the racetams, Alpha-GPC and phosphatidylserine and the role of diet for managing ADHD (and the controversies of diet for ADHD).

He also addresses how protein is assimilated better early in the day than it is later in the day and why those using intermittent fasting might want to shift their feeding window to earlier in the day. Then he delves into the topic of disorders of eating: Anorexia Nervosa, where people starve themselves and Bulimia Nervosa, where people binge and purge their food. Dr. Huberman discusses some common myths about Anorexia, such as the role of media images increasing the rates of Anorexia and the myth of the “perfectionist” anorexic. He also reviews the symptoms and the brain and chemical systems disrupted in this condition. He explains how anorexics become hyperaware of the fat content of foods and develop reflexive habits of fat-hyperawareness. Then Dr. Huberman discusses the most effective treatments ranging from family-based models to those that target the habitual nature of low-fat/calorie food choices. He also discusses new, more experimental clinical trials on MDMA, Psilocybin and Ibogaine for Anorexia and both their promise and risks. Dr. Huberman reviews the latest work on binge eating disorder and brain stimulation, drug treatments and thyroid disruption in Bulimia and why the treatments for Bulimia are so similar to those for ADHD.

They discuss stress, what defines short-term versus long-term stress, and how stress can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on the context. Drs. Huberman and Sapolsky also discuss stress mitigation and how our sense of control over stress mitigation techniques, including exercise, determine health outcomes. Dr. Sapolsky explains some of the key effects of the hormone testosterone — how it can amplify pre-existing tendencies for aggression or sexual behavior, but that it does not produce those behaviors per se. He also explains how testosterone impacts our social hierarchies, sense of confidence, and willingness to embrace challenges of different kinds. He also explains how our behaviors and perceptions shape testosterone levels. And they discuss estrogen and the powerful role it plays in brain development, health and longevity. Finally, they discuss free will, what it means to have free will, and if we have any free will, including how knowledge alone might allow us to make better decisions for ourselves and society.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-robert-sapolsky-science-of-stress-testosterone-and-free-will/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=146s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=390s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=551s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=660s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=915s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=1040s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=1228s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=1350s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=1445s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=1760s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=1952s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=2380s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=2535s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=3095s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=3424s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=3632s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=4280s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=4397s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=4850s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=5024s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtmwtjOoSYU&t=5307s,"00:00:00 Introduction: Dr. Robert Sapolsky; 00:02:26 Sponsors: Roka, InsideTracker, Belcampo; 00:06:30 Stress: Short & Long-Term, Good & Bad; 00:09:11 Valence & Amygdala; 00:11:00 Testosterone: Common Myths vs. Actual Truths; 00:15:15 Behaviors that Affect Testosterone; 00:17:20 Mindsets & Contexts that Affect Testosterone; 00:20:28 How Finger Length Ratios Reflect Prenatal Hormone Levels; 00:22:30 Aggression: Male-Female, Female-Male, & Female-Female; 00:24:05 Testosterone: The Challenge Hypothesis; 00:29:20 How Dopamine Impacts Testosterone & Motivation; 00:32:32 Estrogen: Improves Brain & Longevity BUT TIMING IS KEY; 00:39:40 Are Testosterone & Sperm Counts in Males Really Dropping?; 00:42:15 Stress Mitigation & Our Sense of Control; 00:51:35 How Best to Buffer Stress; 00:57:04 Power of Perception, Choice & Individual Differences; 01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy; 01:11:20 How Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking; 01:13:17 Do We Have Free Will?; 01:20:50 How to Apply Knowledge & Learning; 01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: The Science of Life Without Free Will”; 01:28:27 Reflections, Support of Podcast, & Supporting Stress Research",DtmwtjOoSYU,1080,"['Science', 'Stress', 'Testosterone', 'Free', 'Will']","['this episode', 'Ph.D.', 'Professor', 'Biology', 'Neurology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Stanford University', 'They', 'stress', 'what', 'short-term', 'long-term stress', 'stress', 'the context', 'Huberman', 'Sapolsky', 'stress mitigation', 'our sense', 'control', 'stress mitigation techniques', 'exercise', 'health outcomes', 'some', 'the key effects', 'the hormone testosterone', 'it', 'pre-existing tendencies', 'aggression', 'sexual behavior', 'it', 'those behaviors', 'He', 'testosterone', 'our social hierarchies', 'sense', 'confidence', 'willingness', 'challenges', 'different kinds', 'He', 'our behaviors', 'perceptions', 'testosterone levels', 'they', 'estrogen', 'the powerful role', 'it', 'brain development', 'health', 'longevity', 'they', 'free will', 'what', 'it', 'free will', 'we', 'any free will', 'knowledge', 'us', 'better decisions', 'ourselves', 'society', 'Stanford University', 'discuss stress', 'mitigation techniques', 'including exercise', 'determine health outcomes', 'hormone testosterone', 'embrace challenges', 'perceptions shape testosterone levels', 'discuss estrogen', 'brain development']","1,320,185"

He explains the three major chemical systems that are altered in depression: norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. He discusses genetic predispositions to depression and how stress, thyroid hormone and cortisol play a role in many forms of depression. Dr. Huberman also discusses inflammation as a common feature of many depression symptoms. He reviews eight specific science-supported protocols for treating and avoiding depression, including EPA fatty acids (which have been shown to rival certain prescription treatments), how exercise protects against depression, studies of creatine, adjusting dopamine balance and more. He also discusses the results of ongoing clinical trials for ketamine and psilocybin for depression, how these compounds work and finally, he reviews how ketogenic diets can help in certain cases of depression, especially treatment-resistant major depression.",https://hubermanlab.com/understanding-and-conquering-depression/,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07315724.2009.10719785; https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/9/406; https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2772630,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=430s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=675s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=1120s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=1302s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=1618s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=1910s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=2220s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=2373s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=2510s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=2810s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=3050s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=3170s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=3385s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=3560s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=3770s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=3925s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=4304s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=4830s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=5588s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=6420s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=6890s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu1FMCxoEFc&t=7210s,"00:00:00 Mood Disorders & Maintaining Mental Health (Protocol 1); 00:07:10 Sponsors; 00:11:15 Major Depression; 00:18:40 “Anti-Self” Confabulation; 00:21:42 Autonomic (Vegetative) Symptoms of Depression; 00:26:58 Norepinephrine, Dopamine & Serotonin; 00:31:50 SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.): Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; 00:37:00 Epinephrine/Motor Functions, Dopamine/Motivation & Craving, Serotonin/Emotions; 00:39:33 Physical & Emotional Pain are Linked: Substance P; 00:41:50 Hormones & Depression: Thyroid & Cortisol; 00:46:50 Genetic Susceptibility to Depression: Impact of Stress; 00:50:50 Understanding Biological Mechanism Is Key: Recipes versus Skills; 00:52:50 Tools for Dealing with Depression: Logic & Implementation (Protocol 2); 00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.; 00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*; 01:02:50 How EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine, Quinolinic Acid; 01:05:25 Protocol 4: How Exercise Offsets Depression; 01:11:44 Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*; 01:20:30 Protocol 6*: Ketamine, PCP (*Prescription-Only), & NMDA-Receptor Function; 01:33:08 Protocol 7*: Psychedelics (*In Clinical Trials) for Major Depression: Psilocybin*; 01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid); 01:54:50 Summary of Protocols Covered; 02:00:10 Support & Additional Resources",Xu1FMCxoEFc,1151,"['Understanding', 'Conquering Depression']","['this episode', 'what', 'major depression', 'the biological and psychological level', 'the various treatments', 'that', 'peer-reviewed studies', 'depression', 'He', 'the three major chemical systems', 'that', 'depression', 'norepinephrine', 'serotonin', 'dopamine', 'He', 'genetic predispositions', 'depression', 'cortisol', 'a role', 'many forms', 'depression', 'inflammation', 'a common feature', 'many depression symptoms', 'He', 'eight specific science-supported protocols', 'depression', 'EPA fatty acids', 'which', 'certain prescription treatments', 'exercise', 'depression', 'studies', 'creatine', 'dopamine balance', 'He', 'the results', 'ongoing clinical trials', 'ketamine', 'psilocybin', 'depression', 'these compounds', 'he', 'ketogenic diets', 'certain cases', 'depression', 'especially treatment-resistant major depression', 'treat depression', 'chemical systems', 'depression symptoms', 'avoiding depression', 'including EPA', 'prescription treatments', 'compounds work']","1,475,894"

Dr. Lembke is a psychiatrist expert in treating addictions of all kinds: drugs, alcohol, food, sex, video games, gambling, food, medication, etc. Dr. Lembke is also an expert in the opioid crisis and the author of Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence. Drs. Huberman and Lembke discuss the biology and psychology of why people become addicted to certain substances and behaviors and the key role that our “dopamine balance” plays in creating addiction. They also discuss the science and practice of how to conquer addictions, why people relapse and how to avoid relapsing. Dr. Lembke also shares her expertise on topics closely related to addiction, such as community, shame and lying. She explains why telling the truth—even about the most basic things in daily life, adjusts dopamine levels in our brain. This episode is important for anyone struggling with addictions of any kind, for their friends and families and health care professionals. It is also for anyone who has defeated addiction and is determined to stay clean. Last but not least, it helps explain why all humans do what we do and how we can all maintain a healthy sense of pleasure seeking in life.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-anna-lembke-understanding-and-treating-addiction/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=145s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=420s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=956s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=1100s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=1440s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=1750s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=1847s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=2138s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=2435s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=3005s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=3325s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=4060s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=4305s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=4557s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=4694s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=4810s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=5440s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=6020s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=6685s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=6810s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=7090s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&t=7275s,"00:00:00 Dr. Anna Lembke, Addiction Expert; 00:02:25 Disclaimer & Sponsors: Roka, InsideTracker, Headspace; 00:07:00 Dopamine, Happiness & Impulsivity; 00:15:56 What Is Pleasure?; 00:18:20 Addiction, Boredom & Passion for Life; 00:24:00 Pain-Pleasure Balance Controls Addiction; 00:29:10 Dopamine Deficits, Anhedonia; 00:30:47 Are All Addictions the Same?; 00:35:38 Boredom & Anxiety Lead to Creativity; 00:40:35 Finding Your Passion Starts with Boredom & Action Steps; 00:50:05 How to Break an Addiction; 00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers; 01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted To “Sobriety”?; 01:11:45 Are We All Wired for Addiction?; 01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction; 01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Are Heroes; 01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame; 01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA; 01:40:20 Social Media Addiction; 01:51:25 Narcissism; 01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise; 01:58:10 Reciprocity; 02:01:15 Closing Comments, Resources",p3JLaF_4Tz8,1000,[],"['this episode', 'MD', 'Chief', 'the Stanford Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic', 'Stanford University School', 'Medicine', 'a psychiatrist expert', 'addictions', 'all kinds', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'food', 'sex', 'video games', 'gambling', 'food', 'medication', 'an expert', 'the opioid crisis', 'the author', 'Dopamine Nation', 'Balance', 'the Age', 'Indulgence', 'Huberman', 'Lembke', 'the biology', 'psychology', 'people', 'certain substances', 'behaviors', 'the key role', 'that', 'our “dopamine balance', 'addiction', 'They', 'the science', 'practice', 'addictions', 'people', 'her expertise', 'topics', 'addiction', 'community', 'shame', 'lying', 'She', 'the truth', 'the most basic things', 'daily life', 'dopamine levels', 'our brain', 'This episode', 'anyone', 'addictions', 'any kind', 'their friends', 'families', 'health care professionals', 'It', 'anyone', 'who', 'addiction', 'it', 'all humans', 'what', 'we', 'we', 'a healthy sense', 'life', 'Stanford Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic', 'Stanford University School', 'psychiatrist expert', 'treating addictions', 'video games', 'Finding Balance', 'dopamine balance ”', 'creating addiction', 'conquer addictions', 'people relapse', 'health care professionals', 'has defeated addiction']","1,647,313"

He discusses the science of behavioral tools like acupuncture and hypnosis and directed pressure, including the neural circuits they each activate to modulate our experience of pain or pleasure. Dr. Huberman also discusses whole body pain, pain “syndromes” and novel pain relief compounds such as Acetyl-L-Carnitine, SAMe and Agmatine. He discusses neuroplasticity of the pain system and the key role that visual perception plays in pain modulation. Finally, I address the link between dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin with arousal, pleasure and pain. As always, both basic science and various protocols are described.

d0a91a3c-110a-46b2-9afe-d0febf5ae298,How to Optimize Your Brain-Body Function & Health,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman describes how the body’s organs influence the function and health of our brain and how our brain controls our bodily organs. The conscious awareness of this brain-body dialogue is called interoception. He describes how two factors- mechanical forces (e.g., pressure, pain, volume, etc.) and chemical factors (e.g., gut acidity, microbiome diversity, etc.) combine to influence our moods, control inflammation, immune system, recovery from injury and more. He explains how specific actions of our lungs, heart, spleen, and diaphragm control our brain via the vagus nerve and other neural pathways.

How things smell and taste and chemicals in the tears, breath, and the skin of others have a profound effect on how we feel, what we do and our hormones. He explains the three types of responses to smell, the five types of tastes, the possible existence of the sixth taste sense and how the act of sniffing can make us learn and focus better. He explains how smell and taste reflect brain health and can assess and even promote brain regeneration. Dr. Huberman discusses how eating specific categories of foods makes us crave more of those foods.

He describes more than a dozen protocols to support depth perception, offset near-sightedness, improve mood, sleep, and our ability to focus (both visual focus and our mental focus generally). He also explains how to use eyesight to improve our levels of alertness and why visual hallucinations, lazy eyes and colorblindness occur. Dr. Huberman also describes various compounds that may assist in supporting visual health and possibly improve our vision. Many simple, zero-cost protocols and a lot of scientific mechanisms are covered in this episode in clear language anyone can understand—it is for anyone that values their brain and whether eyesight, young, adult-age or advanced age. 00:00:00 Introduction 00:04:51 Protocol: Concurrent Training For Endurance, Strength, Hypertrophy 00:07:24 The Senses, Vision, Seeing & What We Should All Do To See Better 00:10:35 Our Eyes: What They Really Do, & How They Work 00:14:30 Converting Light Into Electricity Language: Photoreceptors, Retinal Ganglion Cells 00:17:00 We Don’t See Anything Directly: It Is All A Comparison Of Reflected Light 00:19:35 Dogs, Cats, Snakes, Squirrels, Shrimps, Diving Birds, & You(r View Of The World) 00:24:05 Everything You See Is A Best Guess, Blind Spots 00:25:50 Depth Perception 00:28:00 Subconscious Vision: Light, Mood, Metabolism, Dopamine;

827718a7-a84b-4ef6-bf59-815433adaf08,How to Lose Fat with Science-Based Tools,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman describes the science of fat loss, including how fat is mobilized and oxidized (burned) and how to increase fat burning by leveraging the nervous system. Most people don’t realize it, but our neurons connect to our fat and release epinephrine/adrenaline to facilitate fat oxidation. He explains how this can be accomplished with non-exercise movements such as fidgeting to burn thousands of calories of fat a day—a practice that is rarely discussed but very well supported by the scientific literature. He also discusses an optimal fat loss protocol using cold to create shiver, and how specific types and timing of exercise impact fat loss. Dr. Huberman discusses if exercising fasted indeed increases fat oxidation—it turns out the type and duration of exercise really matter. And he discusses the use of caffeine, GLP1 from Mate or guayusa and emerging new prescription compounds for fat loss. The episode includes a lot of tools, links to cost-free resources and an explanation of the science underlying each tool for fat loss.",https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-lose-fat-with-science-based-tools/,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303720709004559?via%3Dihub; https://thecoldplunge.com/pages/protocols,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=360s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=524s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=660s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=818s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=1160s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=1388s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=1500s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=1648s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=1945s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=2085s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=2484s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=2695s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=2850s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=3025s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=3146s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=3375s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=3483s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=3497s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=3600s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=3715s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=3840s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=3900s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=4160s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=4410s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=4590s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=4695s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=4964s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=5165s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=5330s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=5670s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=5722s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=6030s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=6088s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=6180s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=6275s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=6480s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqPGXG5TlZw&t=6680s,"00:00:00 Introduction; 00:06:00 Fat Loss: The Key Role of Neurons; 00:08:44 The First Law of Fat Loss; 00:11:00 Neurons Connect To Fat!

He also describes what to do immediately after a training session (note: this is different than the optimal protocol for cognitive skill training) and as you progress to more advanced levels of performance. He also covers the science of skill-based visualization, which does have benefits, but only if done correctly and at the correct times. Dr. Huberman discusses auto-replay of skill learning in the brain during sleep and the value of adding in post-training ‘deliberately idle’ sessions. He covers how to immediately improve limb-range-of-motion by leveraging cerebellum function, error generation, optimal repetition numbers for learning and more.

He describes the three areas of our body that can remove heat (or bring heat into the body) faster than anywhere else, why that is so, and how proper cooling of these areas with specific protocols can allow people to perform 200-600% more volume and repetitions of resistance exercises at the same weight loads, or to run, cycle or swim significantly further. He also describes how to use directed cooling of so-called glabrous skin: the bottoms of feet, palms and face, to significantly enhance recovery times from exercise. Also, why the common practices of trying to heat up or cool the body via the torso or whole-body submersion in the cold can be inefficient and/or dangerous—and the better alternatives. Finally, Dr. Huberman discusses the temperature effects of caffeine, alcohol and anti-inflammatory compounds.

2251a033-f172-482f-b5ec-8facba025b71,How to Control Your Metabolism by Thyroid & Growth Hormone," In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses metabolism and how our thyroid hormone and growth hormone control our metabolism. He also clarifies that metabolism isn’t just about burning energy; it’s about converting energy from different sources into fuels to build and repair our tissues such as muscle, brain, and tendons and mobilize energy from body fat storage. He discusses the role of iodine, selenium, and salt for thyroid health and how specific exercise protocols, amino acids and temperature can dramatically shift levels of growth hormone release in waking and in sleep. He also describes the current landscape of prescription compounds, peptides, and other factors for changing thyroid and growth hormone levels and some of their risks.

He explains the brain areas that control our desire to eat and our desire to stop eating. He discusses a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV rays from sunlight that reduce our appetite. He also explains that when we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to leverage that fact). He describes how we are basically always eating until we reach a threshold level of fatty acids and amino acids in our gut and the factors that can alter that signaling and make us eat far more than we need. Dr. Huberman also explains how insulin, glucose and glucagon work, why cholesterol is so key for ovary, adrenal, liver and testes function and how the ketogenic diet impacts glucose and thyroid levels. As always, he describes many tools: specific supplements, prescription compounds, specific types (and timing) of exercise to regulate hormones, specific timing and types of eating, ways to reduce sugar cravings by triggering the release of the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), and more.",https://hubermanlab.com/how-our-hormones-control-our-hunger-eating-and-satiety/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxyxcTZccsE&t=0s;

15be58be-8cc1-43fb-8eb4-c762730cfdca,The Science of How to Optimize Testosterone & Estrogen," In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses the hormones testosterone and estrogen and how they impact the brain, body, and behavior at ages after puberty. He also discusses how various behaviors such as exercise (resistance and endurance training) and sex or observing sex impact these hormones and their levels. He asks: “what specifically is it about such activities that impact testosterone and estrogen?”; the resounding theme is that when our nervous system is activated in particular ways, it drives our endocrine system and vascular system to activate or repress certain hormone networks in predictable ways. He also discusses peer-reviewed studies and protocols addressing (at a mechanistic level) how light, cold and heat and respiration (breathing) can positively or negatively impact testosterone and estrogen. And we discuss specific supplements and compounds that peer-reviewed studies illustrate can adjust testosterone and estrogen levels: by changing their binding to other proteins, by raising them directly, or by changing other hormones released from the brain and pituitary. Dr. Huberman discusses optimization in the normal reference ranges for these hormones and discusses pheromones, apnea, menstrual cycles, menopause and andropause. As always, a mix of basic science, biological mechanisms and tools and protocols are discussed.",https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-how-to-optimize-testosterone-and-estrogen/,https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/an-introduction-to-behavioral-endocrinology-9781605353203?q=nelson%20kriegsfeld&lang=en&cc=ca,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=350s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=420s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=603s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=946s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=1258s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=1308s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=1390s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=1606s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=1650s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=1725s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=1884s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=2000s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=2058s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=2613s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=2864s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=3071s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=3229s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=3390s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=3464s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=3879s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=3963s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=4450s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=4902s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=5081s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=5598s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=5760s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=5843s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=5930s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=6014s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=6203s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=6327s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=6463s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=6710s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=7038s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk&t=7157s,"00:00:00 Introduction; 00:05:50 Hormone Optimization; 00:07:00 Salutogenesis: A Powerful Way to Conceptualize Health; 00:10:03 Estrogen and Testosterone: Sources, Levels & Ratios; 00:15:46 The Power of Competition, Plus: Anxiety, Persistence & Dopamine; 00:20:58 Testosterone & Libido Pre-Ovulation; 00:21:48 Estrogen & Sexual Receptivity; Libido In Males; 00:23:10 How Sex Behavior Impacts Testosterone: Observing vs. Actual vs. Abstinence; 00:26:46 Testosterone & Prolactin: Sex Seeking vs Pair Bonding; 00:27:30 DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone): Effects on Levels/Ratios; 00:28:45 Behaviors That Decrease Testosterone (& Cortisol): Parenting & Prolactin; 00:31:24 How Illness Impacts Testosterone & Estrogen: Cytokines, e.g., IL-6; 00:33:20 How Exactly Do Behaviors Change Hormones?; 00:34:18 Pheromones: Miscarriage, Menstrual Cycles, Puberty Onset, & Mate Recognition; 00:43:33 Apnea: A Powerful Bi-Directional Influence On Estrogen & Testosterone; 00:47:44 Mouth vs. Nose Breathing & Hormone Levels: Effects Via Sleep and Direct Effects; 00:51:11 How Sleep Adjusts Cortisol/Testosterone and Cortisol/Estrogen Ratios; 00:53:49 02:CO2 Ratios, Nasal Breathing During Exercise; 00:56:30 Light Viewing Patterns & Hormones: Dopamine, GnRH; 00:57:44 Spring Fever: Tyrosinase, Hair Color, Mating Frequency; 01:04:39 Specificity of Hormone Effects; 01:06:03 Temperature: Cold & Hot Gonads; 01:14:10 How To Exercise: Types, Effort Level, Sequencing; 01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First or Last?)

He describes the predictable relationship between genes, beard growth and balding patterns, and the importance of estrogen for brain development in people of all chromosomal sexes. Finally, Dr. Huberman discuss how the hormones we are exposed to in the womb shape the relative length of our finger digits, the sounds our ears make (yes, you read that correctly), and how those correlate with people’s self-reports of their sexual preferences.

31eb1308-984b-4a9c-a130-287be898075c,The Science of Emotions & Relationships,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses the biology of emotions and moods in the context of relationships. He focuses on the science of how early infant-caregiver attachment, combined with adolescence and puberty shape our adult patterns of attachment. He explains the three universal aspects of emotions, the reality of right-brain versus left-brain personalities, and how the roots of adult attachment are also grounded in specific aspects of puberty. Dr. Huberman reviews what factors determine when puberty starts and ends, and the role of oxytocin and other chemicals in controlling how we perceive and remember others. As always, he refers to various practical tools including new tools for understanding and predicting our emotions before they occur, and neurochemicals that shape human connection.",https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-emotions-relationships/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL02HRFk2vo; https://moodmeterapp.com/; https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25770; https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/lighting-the-brain,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=0s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=310s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=460s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=653s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=921s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=1056s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=1143s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=1268s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=1440s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=1677s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=1960s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=2194s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=2270s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=2539s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=2819s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=2878s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=3034s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=3277s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=3506s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=3625s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=4068s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=4265s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=4458s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=4575s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=4712s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=4809s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=5220s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=5314s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=5443s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=5718s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=5443s; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg&t=5934s,"00:00:00 Introduction; 00:05:10 Announcing New Cost-Free Resources: Captions, NSDR Link; 00:07:40 Emotions: Subjective Yet Tractable; 00:10:53 To Understand Your Emotions: Look At Infancy & Puberty; 00:15:21 Your First Feeling Was Anxiety; 00:17:36 What Are “Healthy Emotions”?; 00:19:03 Digital Tool For Predicting Your Emotions: Mood Meter App; 00:21:08 The Architecture Of A Feeling: (At Least) 3 Key Questions To Ask Yourself; 00:24:00 You Are An Infant: Bonds & Predictions; 00:27:57 Attachment Style Hinges On How You Handle Disappointment; 00:32:40 “Glue Points” Of Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (& Written); 00:36:34 “Emotional Health”: Awareness of the Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic; 00:37:50 An Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias; 00:42:19 Getting Out Of Your Head: The Attentional Aperture; 00:46:59 Puberty: Biology & Emotions On Deliberate Overdrive; 00:47:58 Bodyfat & Puberty: The Leptin Connection; 00:50:34 Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage; 00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Of Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent; 00:58:26 Neuroplasticity Of Emotions: Becoming Specialists & Testing Emotional Bonds; 01:00:25 Testing Driving Brain Circuits For Emotion: Dispersal; 01:07:48 Science-Based Recommendations for Adolescents and Teens: The Autonomy Buffet; 01:11:05 “Right-Brain Versus Left-Brain People”: Facts Versus Lies; 01:14:18 Left Brain = Language, Right Brain = Spatial Awareness; 01:16:15 How To Recognize “Right Brain Activity” In Speech: Prosody; 01:18:32 Oxytocin: The Molecule of Synchronizing States; 01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Are Not For “Empathy”, Maybe For Predicting Behavior 01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy; 01:27:00 Ways To Increase Oxytocin; 01:28:34 Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy and Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities; 01:30:43 Bonding Bodies, Not Just Minds: Vagus Nerve, Depression Relief Via the Body; 01:35:18 A Powerful Tool For Enhancing Range & Depth of Emotional Experience; 01:30:43 MDMA and Other Psychedelic Compounds: Building A Framework; 01:38:54 Roundup, Various Forms of Support",hcuMLQVAgEg,973,"['The Science', 'Emotions', 'Relationships']","['this episode', 'the biology', 'emotions', 'moods', 'the context', 'relationships', 'He', 'the science', 'how early infant-caregiver attachment', 'adolescence', 'puberty', 'our adult patterns', 'attachment', 'He', 'the three universal aspects', 'emotions', 'right-brain', 'left-brain personalities', 'the roots', 'adult attachment', 'specific aspects', 'puberty', 'what factors', 'puberty', 'the role', 'oxytocin', 'other chemicals', 'we', 'others', 'he', 'various practical tools', 'new tools', 'understanding', 'our emotions', 'they', 'neurochemicals', 'that', 'human connection', 'puberty shape', 'adult patterns', 'adult attachment', 'remember others']","1,340,305"
