Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: The Science of Psychedelics for Mental Health,"In this episode, my guest is Robin Carhart-Harris, PhD, distinguished professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco. He is one of leading researchers in the study of how psychedelics such as psilocybin, LSD and DMT can change the human brain and in doing so, be used to successfully treat various mental health challenges such as major depression, anorexia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and addiction. He explains how psilocybin induces sustained changes in adaptive brain wiring and cognition. We discuss the key components of safe and effective psychedelic journeys, the role of hallucinations, the use of eye-masks to encourage people to “go internal,” and music, as well as what effective therapist support consists of before, during and after the session (also known as integration). We discuss micodosing vs. macrodosing and how researchers control for placebo effects in psychedelic research. We also discuss the current legal landscape around psychedelic therapies. Psychedelic therapies are fast emerging as powerful and soon-to-be mainstream treatments for medical health disorders, but they are not without their risks.

How to Optimize Your Water Quality & Intake for Health,"In this episode, I discuss our body’s most vital and essential nutrient—water. I explain the structure of water and how it is used by the cells and tissues of our body, how much water we each need to drink and when in order to optimize our mental focus and physical performance; and I include how exercise, humidity, heat, and caffeine affect our hydration needs. I explain how temperature and pH influence water’s physical properties and if there is any scientific basis for drinking so-called “pH water” or “alkalized water” to improve health. I explain how to test your tap water for contaminants (e.g., endocrine disruptors) and the documented problems with fluoride in drinking water. I provide options for filtering drinking water and describe different water types (e.g., reverse osmosis, hydrogen-enriched, electrolyzed reduced, deuterium depleted, etc.). Since the human body is mostly water (55-80% depending on one’s age) and water has essential roles in health, disease and cellular function, everyone ought to benefit from understanding how best to clean our tap water, hydrate effectively and in some cases, adjust the type of water we drink to allow our brain and body to function optimally in regard to health and performance.

Dr. Oded Rechavi: Genes & the Inheritance of Memories Across Generations,"In this episode, my guest is Oded Rechavi, Ph.D., professor of neurobiology at Tel Aviv University and expert in how genes are inherited, how experiences shape genes and remarkably, how some memories of experiences can be passed via genes to offspring. We discuss his research challenging long-held tenets of genetic inheritance and the relevance of those findings to understanding key biological and psychological processes including metabolism, stress and trauma. He describes the history of the scientific exploration of the “heritability of acquired traits” and how epigenetics and RNA biology can account for some of the passage of certain experience-based memories. He discusses the importance of model organisms in scientific research and describes his work on how stressors and memories can be passed through small RNA molecules to multiple generations of offspring in ways that meaningfully affect their behavior. Nature vs. nurture is a commonly debated theme; Dr. Rechavi’s work represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of that debate, as well as genetic inheritance, brain function and evolution.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-oded-rechavi-genes-and-the-inheritance-of-memories-across-generations/,CDUetQMKM6g,870,"['the Inheritance', 'Memories']","['this episode', 'my guest', 'Oded Rechavi', 'Ph.D.', 'professor', 'neurobiology', 'Tel Aviv University', 'expert', 'genes', 'experiences', 'some memories', 'experiences', 'genes', 'offspring', 'We', 'his research', 'long-held tenets', 'genetic inheritance', 'the relevance', 'those findings', 'key biological and psychological processes', 'metabolism', 'stress', 'trauma', 'He', 'the history', 'the scientific exploration', 'the “heritability', 'acquired traits', 'epigenetics', 'RNA biology', 'some', 'the passage', 'certain experience-based memories', 'He', 'the importance', 'model organisms', 'scientific research', 'his work', 'stressors', 'memories', 'small RNA molecules', 'multiple generations', 'offspring', 'ways', 'that', 'their behavior', 'Nature', 'nurture', 'a commonly debated theme', 'a fundamental shift', 'our understanding', 'that debate', 'genetic inheritance', 'brain function', 'evolution', 'guest is Oded Rechavi', 'Tel Aviv University', 'experiences shape genes', 'processes including metabolism', '“ heritability', 'acquired traits ”', 'RNA biology', 'model organisms', 'RNA molecules', 'brain function']","617,531"

"Dr. Sam Harris: Using Meditation to Focus, View Consciousness & Expand Your Mind","My guest is Sam Harris, Ph.D. Sam earned his bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Stanford University and his doctorate (Ph.D.) in neuroscience from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He is the author of multiple best-selling books and is a world-renowned public-facing intellectual on meditation, consciousness, free will, psychedelics and neuroscience. He is also the creator of Waking Up and the host of the Making Sense podcast. In this episode, we discuss meditation as a route to understanding “the self” and experiencing consciousness, not just changing one’s conscious state. Sam describes several meditation techniques and their benefits, including how meditation fundamentally changes our worldview and how it can be merged seamlessly into daily life. It can help us overcome universal challenges such as distractibility and persistent, internal dialogue (“chatter”) to allow for deep contentment and pervasive shifts in our awareness, all while acknowledging the more immediate stress-lowering and memory-improving effects of meditation.

"Jocko Willink: How to Become Resilient, Forge Your Identity & Lead Others","My guest is Jocko Willink, a retired Navy SEAL officer and author of multiple books on effective leadership and teamwork, self-discipline and mindset, and host of the Jocko Podcast. We discuss how people can build and sculpt their identity and psychology through specific mindsets and actions and how to adapt the self to novel and challenging situations, using specific daily routines. We consider how “energy” actually stems from physical action and describe practical tools and scientific mechanisms for leveraging exercise, cold exposure, nutrition, fasting, hydration, sunlight, mindset and music to make us feel more energized and what that, in turn, does for our life. Jocko explains how discipline and specific daily routines allow for productivity and creativity. And we discuss the qualities of successful leaders, including how to build confidence and real bonds when working with a team or family/friends. Jocko describes a particularly powerful tool of using perspective shifts to allow for ‘detachment’- as a unique way to identify novel solutions to problems. We also discuss the power of early developmental narratives and how experiences of friendship, love, connection and loss can serve as pillars for making us better human beings in all aspects of life. Our conversation covers a wide range of topics, including mental health, physical health and performance, and provides actionable tools that anyone, regardless of age or profession, can apply to live a more effective and meaningful life.",https://hubermanlab.com/jocko-willink-how-to-become-resilient-forge-your-identity-and-lead-others/,__RAXBLt1iM,1022,"[', Forge Your Identity & Lead Others', 'Become Resilient', 'Forge Your Identity']","['My guest', 'a retired Navy SEAL officer', 'author', 'multiple books', 'effective leadership', 'teamwork', 'self-discipline', 'mindset', 'host', 'the Jocko Podcast', 'We', 'people', 'their identity', 'psychology', 'specific mindsets', 'actions', 'the self', 'novel and challenging situations', 'specific daily routines', 'We', '“energy', 'physical action', 'practical tools', 'scientific mechanisms', 'exercise', 'cold exposure', 'nutrition', 'fasting', 'hydration', 'sunlight', 'mindset', 'music', 'us', 'what', 'turn', 'our life', 'Jocko', 'discipline and specific daily routines', 'productivity', 'creativity', 'we', 'the qualities', 'successful leaders', 'confidence', 'real bonds', 'a team', 'family/friends', 'Jocko', 'a particularly powerful tool', 'perspective shifts', 'a unique way', 'novel solutions', 'problems', 'We', 'the power', 'early developmental narratives', 'experiences', 'friendship', 'love', 'connection', 'loss', 'pillars', 'us', 'all aspects', 'life', 'Our conversation', 'a wide range', 'topics', 'mental health', 'physical health', 'performance', 'actionable tools', 'anyone', 'age', 'profession', 'a more effective and meaningful life', 'Navy SEAL officer', 'challenging situations', '“ energy ”', 'leveraging exercise', 'build confidence']","1,361,007"

Nicotine’s Effects on the Brain & Body & How to Quit Smoking or Vaping,"In this episode, I explain how nicotine impacts the brain and body, including its potent ability to enhance attention, focus, and alertness, increase blood pressure and metabolism and reduce appetite. I discuss nicotine’s ability to increase the action of neurochemicals, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine and activate sympathetic (alertness-promoting) neural circuits. I also discuss common nicotine delivery methods, such as cigarettes, vaping, dip, and snuff, and how they each create their own unique experience and how they, but not nicotine itself, cause cancer and other adverse health effects. I also explain science-based tools to permanently quit smoking cigarettes or vaping, including peer-reviewed clinical hypnosis tools, antidepressants, and alternative nicotine replacement (patches, lozenges, gums etc.).

"What Alcohol Does to Your Body, Brain & Health","In this episode, I discuss the physiological effects that drinking alcohol has on the brain and body at different levels of consumption and over time. I also describe genetic differences that predispose certain individuals to alcoholism, binge and habit-drinking. I explain alcohol metabolism in simple terms and how it effectively acts as a poison, leading to cellular stress and damage. I then explain that it impacts neuronal function and changes our thinking and behavior – hallmarks of inebriation. I also discuss how alcohol consumption of different amounts impacts inflammation, stress, neurodegeneration, and cancer risk and negatively impacts the gut microbiome, brain thickness, hormone balance, mood and feelings of motivation. Additionally, I discuss the biology of hangovers and describe science-based strategies to mitigate the severity of a hangover. Since alcohol is one of the most widely consumed recreational substances, this episode ought to be of relevance to everyone.  Indeed, even low-to-moderate alcohol consumption negatively impacts the brain and body in direct ways.

The Science & Treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD),"In this episode, I explain the biology and psychology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)—a prevalent and debilitating condition. I also discuss the efficacy and mechanisms behind OCD treatments—both behavioral and pharmacologic as well as holistic and combination treatments and new emerging treatments, including directed brain stimulation. I explain the neural circuitry underlying repetitive “thought-action loops” and why in OCD, the compulsive actions merely make the obsessions even stronger. I review cognitive-behavioral therapies like exposure therapy and SSRIs, holistic approaches, and nutraceuticals, detailing the efficacy of each approach and what science says about how to combine and sequence treatments.

Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols,"In this episode, I explain the science behind limb range of motion and flexibility and how to increase them by using science-supported protocols. Flexibility is crucial for physical movements and can help prevent injuries, decrease inflammation, modulate physical and mental pain, impact exercise recovery speed and even potentially slow the progression of certain diseases. I explain the biology of flexibility, including the specific neural mechanisms that sense stretch and load (i.e., tension) on the muscles and limbs, as well as how specific brain regions like the insula combine those signals to ultimately control limb range of movement. I also provide science-based stretching and “micro-stretching” protocols that reliably improve limb flexibility with the minimum necessary time investment. I review all the details of those stretching protocols: how often to do them, for how long, their timing relative to other exercises, sets, the time between sets, measuring progress and more.

The Science & Process of Healing from Grief,"This episode, I discuss grief and the challenges of processing losses of different kinds. I explain the biological mechanisms of grief, including how neural circuits for emotional and factual memory combine with those for love and attachment, to create feelings of absence and yearning. I discuss how grief is distinct from depression, yet why they can feel so similar. I also provide science-based tools to assist with the grieving process, including how to reframe and remap the relationship with those we have lost while still maintaining a strong emotional connection to them. I also explain the importance of having and building strong foundational psychological and biological states so that we can better cope with grief when it happens. Finally, I describe tools to adjust those states, including those for accessing sleep, managing stress and emotional swings. This episode is for those suffering from grief but also for everyone, given that we all experience grief at some point in our lives. We recorded this episode before the recent mass shooting tragedies in the United States. While we hope the information in this episode will be of use to anyone suffering from grief of any kind and at any time, we are also careful to acknowledge that many people require additional support and resources.

Dr. Buss describes his work on how people select mates for short and long-term relationships, the dynamics of human courtship, and mate value assessment — meaning how people measure up as potential partners. Dr. Huberman and Dr. Buss also discuss the causes of infidelity and differences for infidelity in men and women. Dr. Buss explains how people evaluate and try to alter other people’s mate value as a means to secure and even poach mates. Dr. Huberman and Dr. Buss discuss monogamous and non-monogamous relationships in humans. And they discuss what Dr. Buss calls “the dark triad”— features common in stalkers and narcissists that relate to sexual and psychological violence in relationships. This episode is sure to be of interest to anyone single or in a relationship who seeks to know how people select mates and anyone who is interested in forming and maintaining healthy romantic partnerships.",https://hubermanlab.com/dr-david-buss-how-humans-select-and-keep-romantic-partners-in-short-and-long-term/,HXzTbCEqCJc,1063,"['Keep', 'Romantic Partners', 'Short', 'Long', 'Term', 'Humans Select']","['this episode', 'Professor', 'Psychology', 'the University', 'Texas', 'the founding members', 'the field', 'evolutionary psychology', 'his work', 'people', 'mates', 'short and long-term relationships', 'the dynamics', 'human courtship', 'mate value assessment', 'people', 'potential partners', 'the causes', 'infidelity', 'differences', 'infidelity', 'men', 'women', 'people', 'other people’s mate value', 'a means', 'mates', 'monogamous and non-monogamous relationships', 'humans', 'they', 'what', 'stalkers', 'narcissists', 'that', 'sexual and psychological violence', 'relationships', 'This episode', 'interest', 'anyone', 'a relationship', 'who', 'people', 'mates', 'anyone', 'who', 'healthy romantic partnerships', 'founding members', 'people select mates', 'mate value assessment — meaning', 'poach mates', 'triad ” — features']","709,601"
The Science of Gratitude & How to Build a Gratitude Practice,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses the science of gratitude, shown in peer-reviewed studies, to have tremendous positive effects on mental and physical health. He explains, however, that most commonly used gratitude practices are ineffective (such as gratitude lists). The key elements of highly effective gratitude practices are described, including the essential need for story (narrative), receiving or perceiving gratitude rather than giving it, and the role that theory of mind plays in this context. Dr. Huberman also discusses why we can’t simply make up feelings of gratitude and how reluctance undermines the process. He also explains the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie the reductions in fear and increases in motivation and lowering of inflammatory chemicals that effective narrative-based gratitude can trigger. Throughout the episode, he uses the science of gratitude to design a brief but highly effective protocol.",https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-gratitude-and-how-to-build-a-gratitude-practice/,KVjfFN89qvQ,1071,"['The Science', 'Gratitude', 'a Gratitude Practice']","['this episode', 'the science', 'gratitude', 'peer-reviewed studies', 'tremendous positive effects', 'mental and physical health', 'He', 'most commonly used gratitude practices', 'gratitude lists', 'The key elements', 'highly effective gratitude practices', 'the essential need', 'story', 'narrative', 'gratitude', 'it', 'the role', 'that', 'theory', 'mind', 'this context', 'we', 'feelings', 'gratitude', 'reluctance', 'the process', 'He', 'the neural circuit mechanisms', 'that', 'the reductions', 'fear', 'increases', 'motivation', 'lowering', 'inflammatory chemicals', 'effective narrative-based gratitude', 'the episode', 'he', 'the science', 'gratitude', 'a brief but highly effective protocol', 'used gratitude practices', 'gratitude lists', 'gratitude practices', 'perceiving gratitude', 'mind plays', 'circuit mechanisms']","801,329"
"Time Perception & Entrainment by Dopamine, Serotonin & Hormones","In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses how our brain and body track time and the role that neurochemicals, in particular dopamine and serotonin, but also hormones such as melatonin, allow us to orient ourselves in time. He reviews the three types of time perception: of the past, of the present, and the future, and how dopamine and serotonin adjust both our perception of the speed of the passage of time and our memory of how long previous experiences lasted. Dr. Huberman also discusses circannual entrainment, which is the process by which our brain and body are matched to the seasons, and circadian (24 hours) entrainment, both of which subconsciously adjust our perceived measurement of time.

Dr. Huberman discusses how our immune system works and science-supported tools we can use to enhance our immune system. He discusses the innate and adaptive immune systems and our various microbiomes—not just in our gut but also in our nose, eyes and mouth and how to keep them healthy. And he reviews how specific patterns of breathing and foods maintain a healthy mucosal barrier that is crucial for fighting infections. Dr. Huberman discusses how certain neurochemicals called catecholamines enhance our immune system function and how to use specific breathing protocols, types and timing of heat and cold exposure, and if appropriate, supplementation to activate catecholamines. He also discusses the role and use of serotonin for the sake of accessing the specific types of sleep for recovering from illness, and he discusses how to increase glymphatic “washout” of brain debris during sleep. Dr. Huberman also reviews fever, the vagus nerve and the use of atypical yet highly effective compounds for rhinitis (nasal inflammation).",https://hubermanlab.com/using-your-nervous-system-to-enhance-your-immune-system/,poOf8b2WE2g,923,"['Your Nervous System', 'Your Immune System']","['This episode', 'you', 'a lot', 'the immune system', 'immune-brain interactions', '12 potential tools', 'immune system function', 'our immune system', 'we', 'our immune system', 'He', 'the innate and adaptive immune systems', 'our various microbiomes', 'our gut', 'our nose', 'eyes', 'mouth', 'them', 'he', 'how specific patterns', 'breathing', 'foods', 'a healthy mucosal barrier', 'that', 'infections', 'certain neurochemicals', 'catecholamines', 'our immune system function', 'specific breathing protocols', 'types', 'timing', 'heat and cold exposure', 'catecholamines', 'He', 'the role', 'use', 'serotonin', 'the sake', 'the specific types', 'sleep', 'illness', 'he', 'glymphatic “washout', 'brain debris', 'sleep', 'fever', 'the vagus nerve', 'the use', 'atypical yet highly effective compounds', 'rhinitis (nasal inflammation', 'immune system', 'system function', 'immune system immune system', 'immune systems', 'mucosal barrier', 'fighting infections', 'immune system function', 'breathing protocols', 'activate catecholamines', 'brain debris', 'vagus nerve']","544,186"
"Dr. Samer Hattar: Timing Light, Food, & Exercise for Better Sleep, Energy & Mood","In this episode, Dr. Huberman hosts Dr. Samer Hattar, Chief of the Section on Light and Circadian Rhythms at the National Institute of Mental Health. Dr. Hattar is a world-renowned expert on how viewing light at particular times adjusts our mood, ability to learn, stress and hormone levels, appetite, and mental health. They discuss how to determine and use your individual light sensitivity to determine the optimal sleep-wake cycle for you. They also discuss how to combine your light viewing and waking time with the timing of your food intake and exercise in order to maximize mental and physical functioning. Dr. Hattar is credited with co-discovering the neurons in the eye that set our circadian clocks and regulate mood and appetite. He explains why even a small shift in daylight savings leads to outsized effects on our biking because of the way that our cells and circadian clocks integrate across many days. And he offers precise tools to rapidly adjust to jetlag, shift work, and reset your clock after a late night of work or socializing.

Nutrients For Brain Health & Performance,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman describes science-supported nutrients for brain and performance (cognition) and general nervous system health. He describes ten tools for this purpose, including specific amounts and sources for Omega-3 fatty acids, which make up the “structural fat” of neurons (nerve cells) and allow them to function across our lifespan. He also reviews data on creatine, phosphatidylserine, anthocyanins, choline, glutamine and how they each impact brain function in healthy people seeking to reinforce and improve their cognition and in those combatting cognitive decline. Dr. Huberman describes both food-based and supplement-based sources for these compounds and their effective dose ranges based on peer-reviewed literature. Then he reviews the three factors: gut-brain signaling, perceived taste, and learned associations that combine with the metabolic and blood-sugar-elevating effects of food to determine what foods we seek and prefer. Amazingly, it’s not just about what tastes good to us. Next, Dr. Huberman explores how we can leverage the neural circuits of learned food preference toward seeking and enjoying the right foods for brain health and performance. He also reviews new data on non-caloric sweeteners and why consuming them with glucose-elevating foods can be detrimental, in some cases rapidly leading to insulin dysregulation. This episode covers more than ten actionable tools for those seeking to improve and/or maintain brain function. It explains modern neuroscience underlying our sense of taste, our food-seeking preferences, and brain metabolism.",https://hubermanlab.com/nutrients-for-brain-health-and-performance/,E7W4OQfJWdw,1030,"['Nutrients', 'Brain Health', 'Performance', 'Brain Health']","['this episode', 'science-supported nutrients', 'brain', 'performance', 'cognition', 'general nervous system health', 'He', 'ten tools', 'this purpose', 'specific amounts', 'sources', 'Omega-3 fatty acids', 'which', 'the “structural fat', 'neurons', 'nerve cells', 'them', 'our lifespan', 'He', 'data', 'creatine', 'phosphatidylserine', 'anthocyanins', 'choline', 'glutamine', 'they', 'each', 'brain function', 'healthy people', 'their cognition', 'those', 'cognitive decline', 'both food-based and supplement-based sources', 'these compounds', 'their effective dose ranges', 'peer-reviewed literature', 'he', 'the three factors', 'gut-brain signaling', 'perceived taste', 'associations', 'that', 'the metabolic and blood-sugar-elevating effects', 'food', 'what foods', 'we', 'it', 'what', 'us', 'we', 'the neural circuits', 'learned food preference', 'the right foods', 'brain health', 'performance', 'He', 'new data', 'non-caloric sweeteners', 'them', 'glucose-elevating foods', 'some cases', 'insulin dysregulation', 'This episode', 'more than ten actionable tools', 'those', 'brain function', 'It', 'modern neuroscience', 'our sense', 'taste', 'our food-seeking preferences', 'brain metabolism', 'system health', 'nerve cells', 'reviews data', 'impact brain function', 'gut-brain signaling', 'perceived taste', 'learned associations', 'brain health', 'insulin dysregulation', 'improve and/or maintain brain function', 'brain metabolism']","1,118,039"
Effects of Fasting & Time Restricted Eating on Fat Loss & Health,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses the science and practice of fasting, also called time-restricted feeding. He reviews the data on how limiting food intake to specific portions of every 24-hour cycle (or fasting longer) impacts weight loss, fat loss specifically, liver health, mental focus, muscle, longevity and more. Dr. Huberman explains how “fasted” is contextual and relates to blood glucose levels and their downstream effects, and how the depth of fasting can be adjusted with behaviors such as different types of exercise or with glucose disposal agents. He also discusses the optimal fasting protocol: and both the absolute (non-negotiable) and variable (contextual) features of a fasting/time-restricted-feeding protocol that will allow you to get the most benefits. He also discusses what does and does not break a fast, the effects of fasting on hormones like testosterone and cortisol, and fertility. Dr. Huberman also reviews how different feeding windows of 8 or 10 or 4 hours differentially impact the effects of fasting and why the classic 8 hour feeding window came to be but also might be ideal. He discusses mechanisms and offers tools to discern the optimal fasting duration and timing for you.",https://hubermanlab.com/effects-of-fasting-and-time-restricted-eating-on-fat-loss-and-health/,9tRohh0gErM,1206,"['Effects', 'Fasting', 'Time', 'Restricted Eating', 'Fat Loss', 'Health', 'Time Restricted Eating', 'Fat Loss']","['this episode', 'the science', 'practice', 'fasting', 'time-restricted feeding', 'He', 'the data', 'food intake', 'specific portions', 'every 24-hour cycle', 'weight loss', 'fat loss', 'liver health', 'mental focus', 'muscle', 'longevity', 'blood glucose levels', 'their downstream effects', 'the depth', 'fasting', 'behaviors', 'different types', 'exercise', 'glucose disposal agents', 'He', 'the optimal fasting protocol', 'both the absolute (non-negotiable) and variable (contextual) features', 'a fasting/time-restricted-feeding protocol', 'that', 'you', 'the most benefits', 'He', 'what', 'a fast', 'the effects', 'hormones', 'testosterone', 'cortisol', 'fertility', 'how different feeding windows', '8 or 10 or 4 hours', 'the effects', 'fasting', 'the classic 8 hour feeding window', 'He', 'mechanisms', 'tools', 'the optimal fasting duration', 'you', 'food intake', 'downstream effects', 'disposal agents', 'fasting protocol', 'hour feeding window', 'discusses mechanisms', 'offers tools', 'fasting duration']","4,700,523"
"Dr. Craig Heller: Using Temperature for Performance, Brain & Body Health","In this episode, Dr. Huberman is joined by Dr. Craig Heller, Professor of Biology at Stanford University and a world expert on the science of temperature regulation. They discuss how the body and brain maintain temperature under different conditions and how almost everyone uses the wrong approach to cool off or heat up. Dr. Heller teaches us the best ways and, in doing so, explains how to offset hyperthermia and hypothermia. He also explains how we can use the precise timing and location of cooling on our body to greatly enhance endurance and weight training performance. He describes how cooling technology discovered and engineered in his laboratory has led to a tripling of anaerobic (weight training) performance and allowed endurance athletes to run further and faster and eliminate delayed onset muscle soreness. Dr. Heller explains how heat impairs muscular and mental performance and how to cool the brain to reduce inflammation and enhance sleep and cognition. Dr. Huberman and Dr. Heller discuss how anyone can apply these principles for themselves, even their dogs!

"Healthy Eating & Eating Disorders – Anorexia, Bulimia, Binging","In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses what drives hunger and satiety and the role our brain, stomach, fat and hormones play in regulating hunger and turning off the desire to eat more. He also addresses how protein is assimilated better early in the day than it is later in the day and why those using intermittent fasting might want to shift their feeding window to earlier in the day. Then he delves into the topic of disorders of eating: Anorexia Nervosa, where people starve themselves and Bulimia Nervosa, where people binge and purge their food. Dr. Huberman discusses some common myths about Anorexia, such as the role of media images increasing the rates of Anorexia and the myth of the “perfectionist” anorexic. He also reviews the symptoms and the brain and chemical systems disrupted in this condition. He explains how anorexics become hyperaware of the fat content of foods and develop reflexive habits of fat-hyperawareness. Then Dr. Huberman discusses the most effective treatments ranging from family-based models to those that target the habitual nature of low-fat/calorie food choices. He also discusses new, more experimental clinical trials on MDMA, Psilocybin and Ibogaine for Anorexia and both their promise and risks. Dr. Huberman reviews the latest work on binge eating disorder and brain stimulation, drug treatments and thyroid disruption in Bulimia and why the treatments for Bulimia are so similar to those for ADHD.

How to Control Your Sense of Pain & Pleasure,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses our sense of pain and pleasure: where and how they each arise in our mind and body and various ways to control their intensity. He discusses the science of behavioral tools like acupuncture and hypnosis and directed pressure, including the neural circuits they each activate to modulate our experience of pain or pleasure. Dr. Huberman also discusses whole body pain, pain “syndromes” and novel pain relief compounds such as Acetyl-L-Carnitine, SAMe and Agmatine. He discusses neuroplasticity of the pain system and the key role that visual perception plays in pain modulation. Finally, I address the link between dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin with arousal, pleasure and pain. As always, both basic science and various protocols are described.

How to Optimize Your Brain-Body Function & Health,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman describes how the body’s organs influence the function and health of our brain and how our brain controls our bodily organs. The conscious awareness of this brain-body dialogue is called interoception. He describes how two factors- mechanical forces (e.g., pressure, pain, volume, etc.) and chemical factors (e.g., gut acidity, microbiome diversity, etc.) combine to influence our moods, control inflammation, immune system, recovery from injury and more. He explains how specific actions of our lungs, heart, spleen, and diaphragm control our brain via the vagus nerve and other neural pathways.

"How Smell, Taste & Pheromone-Like Chemicals Control You","In this episode, Dr. Huberman explains how we sense chemicals through smell, taste and pheromones. How things smell and taste and chemicals in the tears, breath, and the skin of others have a profound effect on how we feel, what we do and our hormones. He explains the three types of responses to smell, the five types of tastes, the possible existence of the sixth taste sense and how the act of sniffing can make us learn and focus better. He explains how smell and taste reflect brain health and can assess and even promote brain regeneration. Dr. Huberman discusses how eating specific categories of foods makes us crave more of those foods.

How to Lose Fat with Science-Based Tools,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman describes the science of fat loss, including how fat is mobilized and oxidized (burned) and how to increase fat burning by leveraging the nervous system. Most people don’t realize it, but our neurons connect to our fat and release epinephrine/adrenaline to facilitate fat oxidation. He explains how this can be accomplished with non-exercise movements such as fidgeting to burn thousands of calories of fat a day—a practice that is rarely discussed but very well supported by the scientific literature. He also discusses an optimal fat loss protocol using cold to create shiver, and how specific types and timing of exercise impact fat loss. Dr. Huberman discusses if exercising fasted indeed increases fat oxidation—it turns out the type and duration of exercise really matter. And he discusses the use of caffeine, GLP1 from Mate or guayusa and emerging new prescription compounds for fat loss. The episode includes a lot of tools, links to cost-free resources and an explanation of the science underlying each tool for fat loss.",https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-lose-fat-with-science-based-tools/,GqPGXG5TlZw,1177,"['Fat', 'Science-Based Tools']","['this episode', 'the science', 'fat loss', 'how fat', 'the nervous system', 'Most people', 'it', 'our neurons', 'our fat and release epinephrine/adrenaline', 'fat oxidation', 'He', 'this', 'non-exercise movements', 'thousands', 'calories', 'fat', 'a practice', 'that', 'the scientific literature', 'He', 'an optimal fat loss protocol', 'cold', 'shiver', 'how specific types', 'timing', 'exercise impact fat loss', 'fat oxidation', 'it', 'the type', 'duration', 'exercise', 'he', 'the use', 'caffeine', 'GLP1', 'Mate', 'fat loss', 'The episode', 'a lot', 'tools', 'links', 'cost-free resources', 'an explanation', 'the science', 'each tool', 'fat loss', 'release epinephrine/adrenaline', 'burn thousands', 'day—a practice', 'loss protocol', 'create shiver', 'exercise impact']","4,053,969"
How to Learn Skills Faster,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses the science and practice of learning physical skills: what it involves at a biological level and what to focus on during skill learning at each stage to maximize learning speed and depth. He also describes what to do immediately after a training session (note: this is different than the optimal protocol for cognitive skill training) and as you progress to more advanced levels of performance. He also covers the science of skill-based visualization, which does have benefits, but only if done correctly and at the correct times. Dr. Huberman discusses auto-replay of skill learning in the brain during sleep and the value of adding in post-training ‘deliberately idle’ sessions. He covers how to immediately improve limb-range-of-motion by leveraging cerebellum function, error generation, optimal repetition numbers for learning and more. As always, scientific mechanisms, peer-reviewed studies and science-based protocols are discussed.",https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-learn-skills-faster/,xJ0IBzCjEPk,1052,[],"['this episode', 'the science', 'practice', 'physical skills', 'what', 'it', 'a biological level', 'what', 'skill learning', 'each stage', 'speed', 'depth', 'He', 'what', 'a training session', 'this', 'the optimal protocol', 'cognitive skill training', 'you', 'more advanced levels', 'performance', 'He', 'the science', 'skill-based visualization', 'which', 'benefits', 'the correct times', 'auto-replay', 'skill learning', 'the brain', 'sleep', 'the value', 'post-training ‘deliberately idle’ sessions', 'He', 'limb-range', 'motion', 'cerebellum function', 'error generation', 'optimal repetition numbers', 'scientific mechanisms', 'peer-reviewed studies', 'science-based protocols', 'maximize learning speed', 'training session', 'skill training', 'does have benefits', 'improve limb-range-of-motion', 'leveraging cerebellum function', 'error generation', 'repetition numbers']","871,386"
Supercharge Exercise Performance & Recovery with Cooling,"In this episode, Dr. Huberman explains the science of heating and cooling the body, a process called thermoregulation—and how to apply that knowledge to significantly improve physical performance. He describes the three areas of our body that can remove heat (or bring heat into the body) faster than anywhere else, why that is so, and how proper cooling of these areas with specific protocols can allow people to perform 200-600% more volume and repetitions of resistance exercises at the same weight loads, or to run, cycle or swim significantly further. He also describes how to use directed cooling of so-called glabrous skin: the bottoms of feet, palms and face, to significantly enhance recovery times from exercise. Also, why the common practices of trying to heat up or cool the body via the torso or whole-body submersion in the cold can be inefficient and/or dangerous—and the better alternatives. Finally, Dr. Huberman discusses the temperature effects of caffeine, alcohol and anti-inflammatory compounds.

Using Cortisol & Adrenaline to Boost Our Energy & Immune System," In this episode, Dr. Huberman describes the biology of two essential hormones we all make: cortisol and adrenaline (also called epinephrine). Cortisol and adrenaline powerfully regulate our levels of energy, focus and immune system function. He describes various science-supported tools and practices to increase or decrease cortisol and/or adrenaline, depending on one’s specific needs and goals. Dr. Huberman also describes the biology of nootropics and how cortisol and adrenaline can improve or degrade learning.

How to Control Your Metabolism by Thyroid & Growth Hormone," In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses metabolism and how our thyroid hormone and growth hormone control our metabolism. He also clarifies that metabolism isn’t just about burning energy; it’s about converting energy from different sources into fuels to build and repair our tissues such as muscle, brain, and tendons and mobilize energy from body fat storage. He discusses the role of iodine, selenium, and salt for thyroid health and how specific exercise protocols, amino acids and temperature can dramatically shift levels of growth hormone release in waking and in sleep. He also describes the current landscape of prescription compounds, peptides, and other factors for changing thyroid and growth hormone levels and some of their risks.

"How Our Hormones Control Our Hunger, Eating & Satiety"," In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses how hormones from our gut, liver, pancreas and brain control our appetite—and the specific tools we can use to adjust those hormones in order to achieve specific goals. He explains the brain areas that control our desire to eat and our desire to stop eating. He discusses a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV rays from sunlight that reduce our appetite. He also explains that when we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to leverage that fact). He describes how we are basically always eating until we reach a threshold level of fatty acids and amino acids in our gut and the factors that can alter that signaling and make us eat far more than we need. Dr. Huberman also explains how insulin, glucose and glucagon work, why cholesterol is so key for ovary, adrenal, liver and testes function and how the ketogenic diet impacts glucose and thyroid levels. As always, he describes many tools: specific supplements, prescription compounds, specific types (and timing) of exercise to regulate hormones, specific timing and types of eating, ways to reduce sugar cravings by triggering the release of the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), and more.",https://hubermanlab.com/how-our-hormones-control-our-hunger-eating-and-satiety/,17O5mgXZ9ZU,1076,"['Our Hormones', 'Our Hunger', 'Eating', 'Satiety', 'Hormones Control']","['this episode', 'our gut', 'liver', 'pancreas', 'brain control', 'our appetite', 'we', 'those hormones', 'order', 'specific goals', 'He', 'the brain areas', 'that', 'our desire', 'our desire', 'He', 'a hormone', 'we', 'all', 'that', 'UV rays', 'sunlight', 'that', 'our appetite', 'He', 'we', 'our appetite', 'that fact', 'He', 'we', 'we', 'a threshold level', 'fatty acids', 'amino acids', 'our gut', 'the factors', 'that', 'us', 'we', 'insulin, glucose and glucagon work', 'cholesterol', 'liver', 'function', 'the ketogenic diet', 'glucose and thyroid levels', 'he', 'many tools', 'specific supplements', 'prescription compounds', 'specific types', 'timing', 'exercise', 'hormones', 'specific timing', 'types', 'eating', 'ways', 'sugar cravings', 'the release', 'the hormone cholecystokinin', 'CCK', 'brain control', 'brain areas', 'stop eating', 'UV rays', 'eat controls', 'testes function', 'prescription compounds', 'regulate hormones', 'reduce sugar cravings', 'hormone cholecystokinin']","1,031,113"
The Science of How to Optimize Testosterone & Estrogen," In this episode, Dr. Huberman discusses the hormones testosterone and estrogen and how they impact the brain, body, and behavior at ages after puberty. He also discusses how various behaviors such as exercise (resistance and endurance training) and sex or observing sex impact these hormones and their levels. He asks: “what specifically is it about such activities that impact testosterone and estrogen?”; the resounding theme is that when our nervous system is activated in particular ways, it drives our endocrine system and vascular system to activate or repress certain hormone networks in predictable ways. He also discusses peer-reviewed studies and protocols addressing (at a mechanistic level) how light, cold and heat and respiration (breathing) can positively or negatively impact testosterone and estrogen. And we discuss specific supplements and compounds that peer-reviewed studies illustrate can adjust testosterone and estrogen levels: by changing their binding to other proteins, by raising them directly, or by changing other hormones released from the brain and pituitary. Dr. Huberman discusses optimization in the normal reference ranges for these hormones and discusses pheromones, apnea, menstrual cycles, menopause and andropause.
